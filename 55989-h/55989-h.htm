<p class="first">More than once in the last chapter was the subject of
submersions and cataclysms brought before the reader, and it may be
convenient to enumerate here the most remarkable cases, and to add one
or two to their number, as well as to dwell at somewhat greater length
on some instances which may be said to have found their way into Welsh
literature. He has already been told of the outburst of the Glasfryn
Lake (p. 367) and Ffynnon Gywer (p. 376), of &#7930;yn &#7930;ech Owen
(p. 379) and the Crymlyn (p. 191), also of the drowning of
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod (p. 383); not to mention that one of my
informants had something to say (p. 219) of the submergence of Caer
Arianrhod, a rock now visible only at low water between Celynnog Fawr
and Dinas Din&#7931;e, on the coast of Arfon. But, to put it briefly,
it is an ancient belief in the Principality that its lakes generally
have swallowed up habitations of men, as in the case of &#7930;yn
Syfa&#273;on (p. 73) and the Pool of Corwrion (p. 57). To these I now
proceed to add other instances, to wit those of Bala Lake, Kenfig Pool,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>&#7930;ynclys, and Helig ab Glannog&rsquo;s
territory including Traeth Lafan.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to begin with historical events, namely those
implied in the encroachment of the sea and the sand on the coast of
Glamorganshire, from the Mumbles, in Gower, to the mouth of the Ogmore,
below Bridgend. It is believed that formerly the shores of Swansea Bay
were from three to five miles further out than the present strand, and
the oyster dredgers point to that part of the bay which they call the
Green Grounds, while trawlers, hovering over these sunken meadows of
the Grove Island, declare that they can sometimes see the foundations
of the ancient homesteads overwhelmed by a terrific storm which raged
some three centuries ago. The old people sometimes talk of an extensive
forest called <i lang="cy">Coed Arian</i>, &lsquo;Silver Wood,&rsquo;
stretching from the foreshore of the Mumbles to Kenfig Burrows, and
there is a tradition of a long-lost bridle path used by many
generations of Mansels, Mowbrays, and Talbots, from Penrice Castle to
Margam Abbey. All this is said to be corroborated by the fishing up
every now and then in Swansea Bay of stags&rsquo; antlers, elks&rsquo;
horns, those of the wild ox, and wild boars&rsquo; tusks, together with
the remains of other ancient tenants of the submerged forest. Various
references in the registers of Swansea and Aberavon mark successive
stages in the advance of the desolation from the latter part of the
fifteenth century down. Among others a great sandstorm is mentioned,
which overwhelmed the borough of Cynffig or Kenfig, and encroached on
the coast generally: the series of catastrophes seems to have
culminated in an inundation caused by a terrible tidal wave in the
early part of the year 1607<a class="noteref" id="xd26e233src" href=
"#xd26e233" name="xd26e233src">1</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>To return to Kenfig, what remains of that old town is near the sea,
and it is on all sides surrounded by hillocks of finely powdered sand
and flanked by ridges of the same fringing the coast. The ruins of
several old buildings half buried in the sand peep out of the ground,
and in the immediate neighbourhood is Kenfig Pool, which is said to
have a circumference of nearly two miles. When the pool formed itself I
have not been able to discover: from such accounts as have come in my
way I should gather that it is older than the growing spread of the
sand, but the island now to be seen in it is artificial and of modern
make<a class="noteref" id="xd26e242src" href="#xd26e242" name=
"xd26e242src">2</a>. The story relating to the lake is given as follows
in the volume of the <i>Iolo Manuscripts</i>, p. 194, and the original,
from which I translate, is crisp, compressed, and, as I fancy, in
Iolo&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A plebeian was in love with Earl Clare&rsquo;s daughter: she
would not have him as he was not wealthy. He took to the highway, and
watched the agent of the lord of the dominion coming towards the castle
from collecting his lord&rsquo;s money. He killed him, took the money,
and produced the coin, and the lady married him. A splendid banquet was
held: the best men of the country were invited, and they made as merry
as possible. On the second night the marriage was consummated, and when
happiest one heard a voice: all ear one listened and caught the words,
&ldquo;Vengeance comes, vengeance comes, vengeance comes,&rdquo; three
times. One asked, &ldquo;When?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the ninth generation
(<i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>),&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;No reason
for us to fear,&rdquo; said the married pair; &ldquo;we shall be under
the mould long before.&rdquo; They lived on, however, and a <i lang=
"cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=
"#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>that is to say, a descendant of
the sixth direct generation, was born to them, also to the murdered man
a <i lang="cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, who, seeing that the time fixed
was come, visited Kenfig. This was a discreet youth of gentle manners,
and he looked at the city and its splendour, and noted that nobody
owned a furrow or a chamber there except the offspring of the murderer:
he and his wife were still living. At cockcrow he heard a cry,
&ldquo;Vengeance is come, is come, is come.&rdquo; It is asked,
&ldquo;On whom?&rdquo; and answered, &ldquo;On him who murdered my
father of the ninth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>.&rdquo; He rises in
terror: he goes towards the city; but there is nothing to see save a
large lake with three chimney tops above the surface emitting smoke
that formed a stinking&#8202;&hellip;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e268src" href="#xd26e268" name="xd26e268src">3</a> On the face of
the waters the gloves of the murdered man float to the young
man&rsquo;s feet: he picks them up, and sees on them the murdered
man&rsquo;s name and arms; and he hears at dawn of day the sound of
praise to God rendered by myriads joining in heavenly music. And so the
story ends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this coast is another piece of water in point, namely Crymlyn, or
&lsquo;Crumlin Pool,&rsquo; now locally called the Bog. It appears also
to have been sometimes called Pw&#7931; Cynan, after the name of a son
of Rhys ab Tewdwr, who, in his flight after his father&rsquo;s defeat
on Hirwaen Wrgan, was drowned in its waters<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e276src" href="#xd26e276" name="xd26e276src">4</a>. It lies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>on Lord Jersey&rsquo;s estate, at a distance of
about one mile east of the mouth of the Tawe, and about a quarter of a
mile from high-water mark, from which it is separated by a strip of
ground known in the neighbourhood as Crymlyn Burrows. The name Crymlyn
means Crooked Lake, which, I am told, describes the shape of this piece
of water. When the bog becomes a pool it encloses an island consisting
of a little rocky hillock showing no trace of piles, or walling, or any
other handiwork of man<a class="noteref" id="xd26e306src" href=
"#xd26e306" name="xd26e306src">5</a>. The story about this pool also is
that it covers a town buried beneath its waters. Mr. Wirt Sikes&rsquo;
reference to it has already been mentioned, and I have it on the
evidence of a native of the immediate neighbourhood, that he has often
heard his father and grandfather talk about the submerged town. Add to
this that Cadrawd, to whom I have had already (pp. 23, 376) to
acknowledge my indebtedness, speaks in the columns of the <i>South
Wales Daily News</i> for February 15, 1899, of Crymlyn as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was said by the old people that on the site of this bog
once stood the old town of Swansea, and that in clear and calm weather
the chimneys and even the church steeple could be seen at the bottom of
the lake, and in the loneliness of the night the bells were often heard
ringing in the lake. It was also said that should any person happen to
stand with his face towards the lake when the wind is blowing across
the lake, and if any of the spray of that water should touch his
clothes, it would be only with the greatest difficulty he could save
himself from being attracted or sucked into the water. The lake was at
one time much larger than at present. The efforts made to drain it have
drawn a good deal of the water from it, but only to convert it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>into a bog, which no one can venture to cross
except in exceptionally dry seasons or hard frost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this I wish to remark in passing, that, while common sense would
lead one to suppose that the wind blowing across the water would help
the man facing it to get away whenever he chose, the reasoning here is
of another order, one characteristic in fact of the ways and means of
sympathetic magic. For specimens in point the reader may be
conveniently referred to page 360, where he may compare the words
quoted from Mr. Hartland, especially as to the use there mentioned of
stones or pellets thrown from one&rsquo;s hands. In the case of
Crymlyn, the wind blowing off the face of the water into the
onlooker&rsquo;s face and carrying with it some of the water in the
form of spray which wets his clothes, howsoever little, was evidently
regarded as establishing a link of connexion between him and the body
of the water&mdash;or shall I say rather, between him and the divinity
of the water?&mdash;and that this link was believed to be so strong
that it required the man&rsquo;s utmost effort to break it and escape
being drawn in and drowned like Cynan. The statement, supremely silly
as it reads, is no modern invention; for one finds that
Nennius&mdash;or somebody else&mdash;reasoned in precisely the same
way, except that for a single onlooker he substitutes a whole army of
men and horses, and that he points the antithesis by distinctly
stating, that if they kept their backs turned to the fascinating flood
they would be out of danger. The conditions which he had in view were,
doubtless, that the men should face the water and have their clothing
more or less wetted by the spray from it. The passage (&sect; 69) to
which I refer is in the <i>Mirabilia</i>, and Geoffrey of Monmouth is
found to repeat it in a somewhat better style of Latin (ix. 7): the
following is the Nennian version:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb407" href="#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span></p>
<p><i lang="la">Aliud miraculum est, id est Oper Linn Liguan. Ostium
fluminis illius fluit in Sabrina et quando Sabrina inundatur ad sissam,
et mare inundatur similiter in ostio supra dicti fluminis et in stagno

<p>&lsquo;There is another wonder, to wit Aber &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan.
The water from the mouth of that river flows into the Severn, and when
the Severn is in flood up to its banks, and when the sea is also in
flood at the mouth of the above-named river and is sucked in like a
whirlpool into the pool of the Aber, the sea does not go on rising: it
leaves a margin of beach by the side of the river, and all the time the
Severn is in flood up to its bank, that beach is not covered. And when
the sea and the Severn ebb, then &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan brings up all it
had swallowed from the sea, and that beach is covered while &#7930;yn
&#7930;iwan discharges its contents in one mountain-like wave and
vomits forth. Now if the army of the whole district in which this
wonder is, were to be present with the men facing the wave, the force
of it would, once their clothes are drenched by the spray, draw them
in, and their horses would likewise be drawn. But if the men should
have their backs turned towards the water, the wave would not harm
them<a class="noteref" id="xd26e329src" href="#xd26e329" name=

<p>One story about the formation of Bala Lake, or &#7930;yn
Tegid<a class="noteref" id="xd26e335src" href="#xd26e335" name=
"xd26e335src">7</a> as it is called in Welsh, has been given at p. 376:
here is another which I translate from a version in Hugh
Humphreys&rsquo; <i lang="cy">&#7930;yfr Gwybodaeth Gyffredinol</i>
(Carnarvon), second series, vol. i, no. 2, p. 1. I may premise that the
contributor, whose name is not given, betrays a sort of literary
ambition which has led him to relate the story in a confused fashion;
and among other things he uses the word <i lang="cy">edifeirwch</i>,
&lsquo;repentance,&rsquo; throughout, instead of <i lang="cy">dial</i>,
&lsquo;vengeance.&rsquo; With that correction it runs somewhat as
follows:&mdash;Tradition relates that Bala Lake is but the watery tomb
of the palaces of iniquity; and that some old boatmen can on quiet
moonlight nights in harvest see towers in ruins at the bottom of its
waters, and also hear at times a feeble voice saying, <i lang="cy">Dial
a &#273;aw, dial a &#273;aw</i>, &lsquo;Vengeance will come&rsquo;; and
another voice inquiring, <i lang="cy">Pa bryd y daw</i>, &lsquo;When
will it come?&rsquo; Then the first voice answers, <i lang="cy">Yn y
dryde&#273; genhedlaeth</i>, &lsquo;In the third generation.&rsquo;
Those voices were but a recollection over oblivion, for in one of those
palaces lived in days of yore an oppressive and cruel prince,
corresponding to the well-known description of one of whom it is said,
&lsquo;Whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive.&rsquo;
The oppression and cruelty practised by him on the poor farmers were
notorious far and near. This prince, while enjoying the morning breezes
of summer in his garden, used frequently to hear a voice saying,
&lsquo;Vengeance will come.&rsquo; But he always laughed the threat
away with reckless contempt. One night a poor harper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>from
the neighbouring hills was ordered to come to the prince&rsquo;s
palace. On his way the harper was told that there was great rejoicing
at the palace at the birth of the first child of the prince&rsquo;s
son. When he had reached the palace the harper was astonished at the
number of the guests, including among them noble lords, princes, and
princesses: never before had he seen such splendour at any feast. When
he had begun playing the gentlemen and ladies dancing presented a
superb appearance. So the mirth and wine abounded, nor did he love
playing for them any more than they loved dancing to the music of his
harp. But about midnight, when there was an interval in the dancing,
and the old harper had been left alone in a corner, he suddenly heard a
voice singing in a sort of a whisper in his ear, &lsquo;Vengeance,
vengeance!&rsquo; He turned at once, and saw a little bird hovering
above him and beckoning him, as it were, to follow him. He followed the
bird as fast as he could, but after getting outside the palace he began
to hesitate. But the bird continued to invite him on, and to sing in a
plaintive and mournful voice the word &lsquo;Vengeance,
vengeance!&rsquo; The old harper was afraid of refusing to follow, and
so they went on over bogs and through thickets, whilst the bird was all
the time hovering in front of him and leading him along the easiest and
safest paths. But if he stopped for a moment the same mournful note of
&lsquo;Vengeance, vengeance!&rsquo; would be sung to him in a more and
more plaintive and heartbreaking fashion. They had by this time reached
the top of the hill, a considerable distance from the palace. As the
old harper felt rather fatigued and weary, he ventured once more to
stop and rest, but he heard the bird&rsquo;s warning voice no more. He
listened, but he heard nothing save the murmuring of the little burn
hard by. He now began to think how foolish he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>had
been to allow himself to be led away from the feast at the palace: he
turned back in order to be there in time for the next dance. As he
wandered on the hill he lost his way, and found himself forced to await
the break of day. In the morning, as he turned his eyes in the
direction of the palace, he could see no trace of it: the whole tract
below was one calm, large lake, with his harp floating on the face of
the waters.</p>
<p>Next comes the story of &#7930;ynclys Pool in the neighbourhood of
Oswestry. That piece of water is said to be of extraordinary depth, and
its name means the &lsquo;swallowed court.&rsquo; The village of
&#7930;ynclys is called after it, and the legend concerning the pool is
preserved in verses printed among the compositions of the local poet,
John F. M. Dovaston, who published his works in 1825. The first stanza
runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Clerk Willin he sat at king Alaric&rsquo;s board,</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">And a cunning clerk was he;</p>
<p class="line">For he&rsquo;d lived in the land of Oxenford</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">With the sons of Grammarie.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">How much exactly of the poem comes from
Dovaston&rsquo;s own muse, and how much comes from the legend, I cannot
tell. Take for instance the king&rsquo;s name, this I should say is not
derived from the story; but as to the name of the clerk, that possibly
is, for the poet bases it on Croes-Willin, the Welsh form of which has
been given me as Croes-Wylan, that is Wylan&rsquo;s Cross, the name of
the base of what is supposed to have been an old cross, a little way
out of Oswestry on the north side; and I have been told that there is a
farm in the same neighbourhood called Tre&rsquo; Wylan,
&lsquo;Wylan&rsquo;s Stead.&rsquo; To return to the legend,
Alaric&rsquo;s queen was endowed with youth and beauty, but the king
was not happy; and when he had lived with her nine years he told Clerk
Willin how he first met her when he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>hunting &lsquo;fair
Blodwell&rsquo;s rocks among.&rsquo; He married her on the condition
that she should be allowed to leave him one night in every seven, and
this she did without his once knowing whither she went on the night of
her absence. Clerk Willin promised to restore peace to the king if he
would resign the queen to him, and a tithe annually of his cattle and
of the wine in his cellar to him and the monks of the White Minster.
The king consented, and the wily clerk hurried away with his book late
at night to the rocks by the Giant&rsquo;s Grave, where there was an
<i lang="cy">ogo&rsquo;</i> or cave which was supposed to lead down to
Faery. While the queen was inside the cave, he began his spells and
made it irrevocable that she should be his, and that his fare should be
what fed on the king&rsquo;s meadow and what flowed in his cellar. When
the clerk&rsquo;s potent spells forced the queen to meet him to
consummate his bargain with the king, what should he behold but a grim
ogress, who told him that their spells had clashed. She explained to
him how she had been the king&rsquo;s wife for thirty years, and how
the king began to be tired of her wrinkles and old age. Then, on
condition of returning to the Ogo to be an ogress one night in seven,
she was given youth and beauty again, with which she attracted the king
anew. In fact, she had promised him happiness</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Till within his hall the flag-reeds tall</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">And the long green rushes grow.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The ogress continued in words which made the clerk see
how completely he had been caught in his own net:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Then take thy bride to thy cloistered bed,</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">As by oath and spell decreed,</p>
<p class="line">And nought be thy fare but the pike and the dare,</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">And the water in which they feed.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The clerk had succeeded in restoring peace at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s banqueting board, but it was the
peace of the dead;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">For down went the king, and his palace and all,</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">And the waters now o&rsquo;er it flow,</p>
<p class="line">And already in his hall do the flag-reeds tall</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">And the long green rushes grow.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the visitor will, Dovaston says, find
Willin&rsquo;s peace relieved by the stories which the villagers have
to tell of that wily clerk, of Croes-Willin, and of &lsquo;the cave
called the Grim Ogo&rsquo;; not to mention that when the lake is clear,
they will show you the towers of the palace below, the &#7930;ynclys,
which the Brython of ages gone by believed to be there.</p>
<p>We now come to a different story about this pool, namely, one which
has been preserved in Latin by the historian Humfrey Lhuyd, or Humphrey
&#7930;wyd, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After the description of <i>Gwynedh</i>, let vs now come to
<i>Powys</i>, the seconde kyngedome of <i>VVales</i>, which in the time
of German Altisiodorensis [St. Germanus of Auxerre], which preached
sometime there, agaynst Pelagius Heresie: was of power, as is gathered
out of his life. The kynge wherof, as is there read, bycause he refused
to heare that good man: by the secret and terrible iudgement of God,
with his Palace, and all his householde: was swallowed vp into the
bowels of the Earth, in that place, whereas, not farre from Oswastry,
is now a standyng water, of an vnknowne depth, called <i>Lhunclys</i>,
that is to say: the deuouryng of the Palace. And there are many
Churches founde in the same Province, dedicated to the name of
German<a class="noteref" id="xd26e455src" href="#xd26e455" name=
"xd26e455src">8</a>.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href=
"#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have not succeeded in finding the story in any of the lives of St.
Germanus, but Nennius, &sect; 32, mentions a certain Benli, whom he
describes as <i lang="la">rex iniquus atque tyrannus valde</i>, who,
after refusing to admit St. Germanus and his following into his city,
was destroyed with all his courtiers, not by water, however, but by
fire from heaven. But the name Benli, in modern Welsh spelling
Ben&#7931;i<a class="noteref" id="xd26e502src" href="#xd26e502" name=
"xd26e502src">9</a>, points to the Moel Famau range of mountains, one
of which is known as Moel Fen&#7931;i, between Ruthin and Mold, rather
than to any place near Oswestry. In any case there is no reason to
suppose that this story with its Christian and ethical motive is
anything like so old as the substratum of Dovaston&rsquo;s verses.</p>
<p>The only version known to me in the Welsh language of the
&#7930;ynclys legend is to be found printed in the <i>Brython</i> for
1863, p. 338, and it may be summarized as follows:&mdash;The
&#7930;ynclys family were notorious for their riotous living, and at
their feasts a voice used to be heard proclaiming, &lsquo;Vengeance is
coming, coming,&rsquo; but nobody took it much to heart. However, one
day a reckless maid asked the voice, &lsquo;When?&rsquo; The prompt
reply was to the effect that it was in the sixth generation: the voice
was heard no more. So one night, when the sixth heir in descent from
the time of the warning last heard was giving a great drinking feast,
and music had been vigorously contributing to the entertainment of host
and guest, the harper went outside for a breath of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>air;
but when he turned to come back, lo and behold! the whole court had
disappeared. Its place was occupied by a quiet piece of water, on whose
waves he saw his harp floating, nothing more.</p>
<p>Here must, lastly, be added one more legend of submergence, namely,
that supposed to have taken place some time or other on the north coast
of Carnarvonshire. In the <i>Brython</i> for 1863, pp. 393&ndash;4, we
have what purports to be a quotation from Owen Jones&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">Aberconwy a&rsquo;i Chyffiniau</i>, &lsquo;Conway and its
Environs,&rsquo; a work which I have not been able to find. Here one
reads of a tract of country supposed to have once extended from the
Gogarth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e539src" href="#xd26e539" name=
"xd26e539src">10</a>, &lsquo;the Great Orme,&rsquo; to Bangor, and from
&#7930;anfair Fechan to Ynys Seiriol, &lsquo;Priestholme or Puffin
Island,&rsquo; and of its belonging to a wicked prince named Helig ab
Glannawc or Glannog<a class="noteref" id="xd26e586src" href="#xd26e586"
name="xd26e586src">11</a>, from whom it was called <i lang="cy">Tyno
Helig</i>, &lsquo;Helig&rsquo;s Hollow.&rsquo; Tradition, the writer
says, fixes the spot where the court stood about halfway between
Penmaen Mawr and Pen y Gogarth, &lsquo;the Great Orme&rsquo;s
Head,&rsquo; over against Trwyn yr Wylfa; and the story relates that
here a calamity had been foretold four generations before it came,
namely as the vengeance of Heaven on Helig ab Glannog for his nefarious
impiety. As that ancient prince rode through his fertile heritage one
day at the approach of night, he heard the voice of an invisible
follower warning him that &lsquo;Vengeance is coming, coming.&rsquo;
The wicked old prince once asked excitedly, &lsquo;When?&rsquo; The
answer was, &lsquo;In the time of thy grandchildren,
great-grandchildren, and their children.&rsquo; Peradventure
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>Helig calmed himself with the thought, that, if
such a thing came, it would not happen in his lifetime. But on the
occasion of a great feast held at the court, and when the family down
to the fifth generation were present taking part in the festivities,
one of the servants noticed, when visiting the mead cellar to draw more
drink, that water was forcing its way in. He had only time to warn the
harper of the danger he was in, when all the others, in the midst of
their intoxication, were overwhelmed by the flood.<a id="xd26e604"
name="xd26e604"></a></p>
<p>These inundation legends have many points of similarity among
themselves: thus in those of &#7930;ynclys, Syfa&#273;on, &#7930;yn
Tegid, and Tyno Helig, though they have a ring of austerity about them,
the harper is a favoured man, who always escapes when the banqueters
are all involved in the catastrophe. The story, moreover, usually
treats the submerged habitations as having sunk intact, so that the
ancient spires and church towers may still at times be seen: nay the
chimes of their bells may be heard by those who have ears for such
music. In some cases there may have been, underlying the legend, a
trace of fact such as has been indicated to me by Mr. Owen M. Edwards,
of Lincoln College, in regard to Bala Lake. When the surface of that
water, he says, is covered with broken ice, and a south-westerly wind
is blowing, the mass of fragments is driven towards the north-eastern
end near the town of Bala; and he has observed that the friction
produces a somewhat metallic noise which a quick imagination may
convert into something like a distant ringing of bells. Perhaps the
most remarkable instance remains to be mentioned: I refer to
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod, as the submerged country of Gwy&#273;no
Garanhir is termed, see p. 382 above. To one portion of his fabled
realm the nearest actual centres of population are Aberdovey and Borth
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>either side of the estuary of the Dovey. As
bursar of Jesus College I had business in 1892 in the Golden Valley of
Herefordshire, and I stayed a day or two at Dorstone enjoying the
hospitality of the rectory, and learning interesting facts from the
rector, Mr. Prosser Powell, and from Mrs. Powell in particular, as to
the folklore of the parish, which is still in several respects very
Welsh. Mrs. Powell, however, did not confine herself to Dorstone or the
Dore Valley, for she told me as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I was at
Aberdovey in 1852, and I distinctly remember that my childish
imagination was much excited by the legend of the city beneath the sea,
and the bells which I was told might be heard at night. I used to lie
awake trying, but in vain, to catch the echoes of the chime. I was only
seven years old, and cannot remember who told me the story, though I
have never forgotten it.&rsquo; Mrs. Powell added that she has since
heard it said, that at a certain stage of the tide at the mouth of the
Dovey, the way in which the waves move the pebbles makes them produce a
sort of jingling noise which has been fancied to be the echo of distant
bells ringing.</p>
<p>These clues appeared too good to be dropped at once, and the result
of further inquiries led Mrs. Powell afterwards to refer me to <i>The
Monthly Packet</i> for the year 1859, where I found an article headed
&lsquo;Aberdovey Legends,&rsquo; and signed M. B., the initials, Mrs.
Powell thought, of Miss Bramston of Winchester. The writer gives a
sketch of the story of the country overflowed by the neighbouring
portion of Cardigan Bay, mentioning, p. 645, that once on a time there
were great cities on the banks of the Dovey and the Disynni.
&lsquo;Cities with marble wharfs,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;busy
factories, and churches whose towers resounded with beautiful peals and
chimes of bells.&rsquo; She goes on to say that &lsquo;Mausna
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>is the name of the city on the Dovey; its
eastern suburb was at the sand-bank now called Borth, its western
stretched far out into the sea.&rsquo; What the name Mausna may be I
have no idea, unless it is the result of some confusion with that of
the great turbary behind Borth, namely Mochno, or <i lang="cy">Cors
Fochno</i>, &lsquo;Bog of Mochno.&rsquo; The name Borth stands for
<i lang="cy">Y Borth</i>, &lsquo;the Harbour,&rsquo; which, more
adequately described, was once <i>Porth Wy&#273;no</i>,
&lsquo;Gwy&#273;no&rsquo;s Harbour.&rsquo; The writer, however, goes on
with the story of the wicked prince, who left open the sluices of the
sea-wall protecting his country and its capital: we read on as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;But though the sea will not give back that fair
city to light and air, it is keeping it as a trust but for a time, and
even now sometimes, though very rarely, eyes gazing down through the
green waters can see not only the fluted glistering sand dotted here
and there with shells and tufts of waving sea-weed, but the wide
streets and costly buildings of that now silent city. Yet not always
silent, for now and then will come chimes and peals of bells, sometimes
near, sometimes distant, sounding low and sweet like a call to prayer,
or as rejoicing for a victory. Even by day these tones arise, but more
often they are heard in the long twilight evenings, or by night.
English ears have sometimes heard these sounds even before they knew
the tale, and fancied that they must come from some church among the
hills, or on the other side of the water, but no such church is there
to give the call; the sound and its connexion is so pleasant, that one
does not care to break the spell by seeking for the origin of the
legend, as in the idler tales with which that neighbourhood
abounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dream about &lsquo;the wide streets and costly buildings of that
now silent city&rsquo; seems to have its counterpart on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>the
western coast of Erin&mdash;somewhere, let us say, off the cliffs of
Moher<a class="noteref" id="xd26e630src" href="#xd26e630" name=
"xd26e630src">12</a>, in County Clare&mdash;witness Gerald
Griffin&rsquo;s lines, to which a passing allusion has already been
made, p. 205:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A story I heard on the cliffs of the West,</p>

<p class="line xd26e394">Soon close the white waters to screen it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The allusion to the submarine chimes would make it
unpardonable to pass by unnoticed the well-known Welsh air called
<i lang="cy">Clychau Aberdyfi</i>, &lsquo;The Bells of
Aberdovey,&rsquo; which I have always suspected of taking its name from
fairy bells<a class="noteref" id="xd26e657src" href="#xd26e657" name=
"xd26e657src">13</a>. This popular tune is of unknown origin, and the
words to which it is usually sung make the bells say <i lang="cy">un,
dau, tri, pedwar, pump, chwech</i>, &lsquo;one, two, three, four, five,
six&rsquo;; and I have heard a charming Welsh vocalist putting on
<i lang="cy">saith</i>, &lsquo;seven,&rsquo; in her rendering of the
song. This is not to be wondered at, as her instincts must have
rebelled against such a commonplace number as six in a song redolent of
old-world sentiment. But our fairy bells ought to have stopped at five:
this would seem to have been forgotten when the melody and the present
words were wedded together. At any rate our stories seem to suggest
that fairy counting did not go beyond the fingering of one hand. The
only Welsh fairy represented counting is made to do it all by fives:
she counts <i lang="cy">un, dau, tri, pedwar, pump; un, dau, tri,
pedwar, pump</i>, as hard as her tongue can go. For on the number of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>times she can repeat the five numerals at a
single breath depends the number of the live stock of each kind, which
are to form her dowry: see p. 8 above, and as to music in fairy tales,
see pp. 202, 206, 292.</p>
<p>Now that a number of our inundation stories have been passed in
review in this and the previous chapter, some room may be given to the
question of their original form. They separate themselves, as it will
have been seen, into at least two groups: (1) those in which the cause
of the catastrophe is ethical, the punishment of the wicked and
dissolute; and (2) those in which no very distinct suggestion of the
kind is made. It is needless to say that everything points to the
comparative lateness of the fully developed ethical motive; and we are
not forced to rest content with this theoretical distinction, for in
more than one of the instances we have the two kinds of story. In the
case of &#7930;yn Tegid, the less known and presumably the older story
connects the formation of the lake with the neglect to keep the stone
door of the well shut, while the more popular story makes the
catastrophe a punishment for wicked and riotous living: compare pp.
377, 408, above. So with the older story of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod, on
which we found the later one of the tipsy Seithennin as it were
grafted, p. 395. The keeping of the well shut in the former case, as
also in that of Ffynnon Gywer, was a precaution, but the neglect of it
was not the cause of the ensuing misfortune. Even if we had stories
like the Irish ones, which make the sacred well burst forth in pursuit
of the intruder who has gazed into its depths, it would by no means be
of a piece with the punishment of riotous and lawless living. Our
comparison should rather be with the story of the Curse of Pantannas,
where a man incurred the wrath of the fairies by ploughing up ground
which they wished to retain as a green sward; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>but
the threatened vengeance for that act of culture did not come to pass
for a century, till the time of one, in fact, who is not charged with
having done anything to deserve it. The ethics of that legend are, it
is clear, not easy to discover, and in our inundation stories one may
trace stages of development from a similarly low level. The case may be
represented thus: a divinity is offended by a man, and for some reason
or other the former wreaks his vengeance, not on the offender, but on
his descendants. This minimum granted, it is easy to see, that in time
the popular conscience would fail to rest satisfied with the cruel idea
of a jealous divinity visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children. One may accordingly distinguish the following
stages:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The legend lays it down as a fact that the father was very
wicked.</p>
<p>2. It makes his descendants also wicked like him.</p>
<p>3. It represents the same punishment overtaking father and sons,
ancestor and descendants.</p>
<p>4. The simplest way to secure this kind of equal justice was, no
doubt, to let the offending ancestors live on to see their descendants
of the generation for whose time the vengeance had been fixed, and to
let them be swept away with them in one and the same cataclysm, as in
the Welsh versions of the Syfa&#273;on and Kenfig legends, possibly
also in those of &#7930;yn Tegid and Tyno Helig, which are not explicit
on this point.</p>
<p>Let us for a moment examine the indications of the time to which the
vengeance is put off. In the case of the landed families of ancient
Wales, every member of them had his position and liabilities settled by
his pedigree, which had to be exactly recorded down to the eighth
generation or eighth lifetime in Gwyne&#273;, and to the seventh in
Gwent and Dyfed. Those generations were reckoned the limits of
recognized family relationship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421"
href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>according to the Welsh Laws,
and to keep any practical reckoning of the kind, extending always back
some two centuries, must have employed a class of professional
men<a class="noteref" id="xd26e692src" href="#xd26e692" name=
"xd26e692src">14</a>. In any case the ninth generation, called in Welsh
<i lang="cy">y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, which is a term in use all over
the Principality at the present day, is treated as lying outside all
recognized kinship. Thus if <i>AB</i> wishes to say that he is no
relation to <i>CD</i>, he will say that he is not related <i lang=
"cy">o fewn y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, &lsquo;within the ninth
degree,&rsquo; or <i lang="cy">hyd y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, &lsquo;up to
the ninth degree,&rsquo; it being understood that in the ninth degree
and beyond it no relationship is reckoned. Folklore stories, however,
seem to suggest another interpretation of the word <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i>, and fewer generations in the direct line as
indicated in the following table. For the sake of simplicity the
founder of the family is here assumed to have at least two sons,
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and each succeeding generation to consist of one
son only; and lastly the women are omitted altogether:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>In reckoning the relationships between the collateral members of the
family, one counts not generations or begettings, not removes or
degrees, but ancestry or the number of ancestors, so that the father or
founder of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>the family only counts once. Thus his
descendants A<sup>d</sup> and B<sup>d</sup> in the sixth generation or
lifetime, are fourth cousins separated from one another by nine
ancestors: that is, they are related in the ninth <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i>. In other words, A<sup>d</sup> has five ancestors
and B<sup>d</sup> has also five, but as they have one ancestor in
common, the father of the family, they are not separated by 5 + 5
ancestors, but by 5 + 5 - 1, that is by 9. Similarly, one being always
subtracted, the third cousins A<sup>c</sup> and B<sup>c</sup> are
related in the seventh <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>, and the second
cousin in the fifth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>: so with the others in
odd numbers downwards, and also with the relatives reckoned upwards to
the seventh or eighth generation, which would mean collaterals
separated by eleven or thirteen ancestors respectively. This reckoning,
which is purely conjectural, is based chiefly on the Kenfig story,
which foretold the vengeance to come in the ninth <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i> and otherwise in the time of the <i lang=
"cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, that is to say in the sixth lifetime. This
works out all right if only by the ninth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i> we
understand the generation or lifetime when the collaterals are
separated by nine ancestors, for that is no other than the sixth from
the founder of the family. The Welsh version of the &#7930;ynclys
legend fixes on the same generation, as it says <i lang="cy">yn oes
wyrion, gorwyrion, esgynny&#273; a goresgynny&#273;</i>, &lsquo;in the
lifetime of grandsons, great-grandsons, ascensors, and their
children,&rsquo; for these last&rsquo;s time is the sixth generation.
In the case of the Syfa&#273;on legend the time of the vengeance is the
ninth <i lang="cy">cenhedlaeth</i> or generation, which must be
regarded as probably a careless way of indicating the generation when
the collaterals are separated by nine ancestors, that is to say the
sixth from the father of the family. It can hardly have the other
meaning, as the sinning ancestors are represented as then still living.
The case of the Tyno Helig legend is different, as we have the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>time announced to the offending ancestor
described as <i lang="cy">amser dy wyrion, dy orwyrion, a dy
esgyny&#273;ion</i>, &lsquo;the time of thy grandsons, thy
great-grandsons, and thy ascensors,&rsquo; which would be only the
fifth generation with collaterals separated only by seven ancestors,
and not nine. But the probability is that <i lang=
"cy">goresgyny&#273;ion</i> has been here accidentally omitted, and
that the generation indicated originally was the same as in the others.
This, however, will not explain the Bala legend, which fixes the time
for the third generation, namely, immediately after the birth of the
offending prince&rsquo;s first grandson. If, however, as I am inclined
to suppose, the sixth generation with collaterals severed by nine
ancestors was the normal term in these stories, it is easy to
understand that the story-teller might wish to substitute a generation
nearer to the original offender, especially if he was himself to be
regarded as surviving to share in the threatened punishment: his living
to see the birth of his first grandson postulated no extraordinary
longevity.</p>
<p>The question why fairy vengeance is so often represented deferred
for a long time can no longer be put off. Here three or four answers
suggest themselves:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The story of the Curse of Pantannas relates how the offender was
not the person punished, but one of his descendants a hundred or more
years after his time, while the offender is represented escaping the
fairies&rsquo; vengeance because he entreated them very hard to let him
go unpunished. All this seems to me but a sort of protest against the
inexorable character of the little people, a protest, moreover, which
was probably invented comparatively late.</p>
<p>2. The next answer is the very antithesis of the Pantannas one; for
it is, that the fairies delay in order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>involve all the more
men and women in the vengeance wreaked by them: I confess that I see no
reason to entertain so sinister an idea.</p>
<p>3. A better answer, perhaps, is that the fairies were not always in
a position to harm him who offended them. This may well have been the
belief as regards any one who had at his command the dreaded potency of
magic. Take for instance the Irish story of a king of Erin called
Eochaid Airem, who, with the aid of his magician or druid Dal&aacute;n,
defied the fairies, and dug into the heart of their underground
station, until, in fact, he got possession of his queen, who had been
carried thither by a fairy chief named Mider. Eochaid, assisted by his
druid and the powerful Ogams which the latter wrote on rods of yew, was
too formidable for the fairies, and their wrath was not executed till
the time of Eochaid&rsquo;s unoffending grandson, Conaire M&oacute;r,
who fell a victim to it, as related in the epic story of <i lang=
"cy">Bruden D&aacute;derga</i>, so called from the palace where Conaire
was slain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e925src" href="#xd26e925" name=
"xd26e925src">15</a>.</p>
<p>4. Lastly, it may be said that the fairies being supposed deathless,
there would be no reason why they should hurry; and even in case the
delay meant a century or two, that makes no perceptible approach to the
extravagant scale of time common enough in our fairy tales, when, for
instance, they make a man who has whiled ages away in fairyland, deem
it only so many minutes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e938src" href=
"#xd26e938" name="xd26e938src">16</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever the causes may have been which gave our stories their form
in regard of the delay in the fairy revenge, it is clear that Welsh
folklore could not allow this delay to extend beyond the sixth
generation with its cousinship of nine ancestries, if, as I gather, it
counted kinship no further. Had one projected it on the seventh or the
eighth generation, both of which are contemplated in the Laws, it would
not be folklore. It would more likely be the lore of the landed gentry
and of the powerful families whose pedigrees and ramifications of
kinship were minutely known to the professional men on whom it was
incumbent to keep themselves, and those on whom they depended, well
informed in such matters.</p>
<p>It remains for me to consider the non-ethical motive of the other
stories, such as those which ascribe negligence and the consequent
inundation to the woman who has the charge of the door or lid of the
threatening well. Her negligence is not the cause of the catastrophe,
but it leaves the way open for it. What then can have been regarded the
cause? One may gather something to the point from the Irish story where
the divinity of the well is offended because a woman has gazed into its
depths, and here probably, as already suggested (p. 392), we come
across an ancient tabu directed against women, which may have applied
only to certain wells of peculiarly sacred character. It serves,
however, to suggest that the divinities of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>water-world were not disinclined to seize every
opportunity of extending their domain on the earth&rsquo;s surface; and
I am persuaded that this was once a universal creed of some race or
other in possession of these islands. Besides the Irish legends already
mentioned (pp. 382, 384) of the formation of Lough Neagh, Lough Ree,
and others, witness the legendary annals of early Ireland, which, by
the side of battles, the clearing of forests, and the construction of
causeways, mention the bursting forth of lakes and rivers; that is to
say, the formation or the coming into existence, or else the serious
expansion, of certain of the actual waters of the country. For the
present purpose the details given by <i>The Four Masters</i> are
sufficient, and I have hurriedly counted their instances as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This makes an aggregate of thirty-five lakes and forty-six rivers,
that is to say a total of eighty-one eruptions. But I ought, perhaps,
to explain that under the head of lakes I have included not only
separate pieces of water, but also six inlets of the sea, such as
Strangford Lough and the like. Still more to the point is it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>to mention that of the lakes two are said to
have burst forth at the digging of graves. Thus, <span class=
"sc"><abbr title="Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2535, <i>The Four
Masters</i> have the following: &lsquo;Laighlinne, son of Parthalon,
died in this year. When his grave was dug, Loch Laighlinne sprang forth
in Ui Mac Uais, and from him it is named<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1370src" href="#xd26e1370" name="xd26e1370src">17</a>.&rsquo;
O&rsquo;Donovan, the editor and translator of <i>The Four Masters</i>,
supposes it to be somewhere to the south-west of Tara, in Meath.
Similarly, <span class="sc"><abbr title="Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span>
4694, they say of a certain Melghe Molbthach, &lsquo;When his grave was
digging, Loch Melghe burst forth over the land in Cairbre, so that it
was named from him.&rsquo; This is said to be now called Lough Melvin,
on the confines of the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, and Fermanagh.
These two instances are mentioned by <i>The Four Masters</i>; and here
is one given by Stokes in the Rennes <i lang=
"cy">Dinds&#775;enchas</i>: see the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>,
xv. 428&ndash;9. It has to do with <i>Loch Garman</i>, as Wexford
Harbour was called in Irish, and it runs thus: &lsquo;<i>Loch
Garman</i>, whence is it? Easy to say. Garman Glas, son of Dega, was
buried there, and when his grave was dug then the lake burst throughout
the land. Whence <i>Loch Garman</i>.&rsquo; It matters not here that
there are alternative accounts of the name.</p>
<p>The meaning of all this seems to be that cutting the green sward or
disturbing the earth beneath was believed in certain cases to give
offence to some underground divinity or other connected with the world
of waters. That divinity avenged the annoyance or offence given him by
causing water to burst forth and form a lake forthwith. The nearness of
such divinities to the surface seems not a little remarkable,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>and it is shown not only in the folklore which
has been preserved for us by <i>The Four Masters</i>, but also by the
usual kind of story about a neglected well door. These remarks suggest
the question whether it was not one of the notions which determined
surface burials, that is, burials in which no cutting of the ground
took place, the cists or chambers and the bodies placed in them being
covered over by the heaping on of earth or stones brought from a more
or less convenient distance. It might perhaps be said that all this
only implied individuals of a character to desecrate the ground and
call forth the displeasure of the divinities concerned; and for that
suggestion folklore parallels, it is true, could be adduced. But it is
hardly adequate: the facts seem to indicate a more general objection on
the part of the powers in point; and they remind one rather of the
clause said to be inserted in mining leases in China with the object,
if one may trust the newspapers, of preventing shafts from being sunk
below a certain depth, for fear of offending the susceptibilities of
the demons or dragons ruling underground.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the fact, that Celtic folklore connects
the underground divinities intimately with water; for one may briefly
say that they have access wherever water can take them. With this
qualification the belief may be said to have lingered lately in Wales,
for instance, in connexion with &#7930;yn Barfog, near Aberdovey.
&lsquo;It is believed to be very perilous,&rsquo; Mr. Pughe says, p.
142 above, &lsquo;to let the waters out of the lake&rsquo;; and not
long before he wrote, in 1853, an aged inhabitant of the district
informed him &lsquo;that she recollected this being done during a
period of long drought, in order to procure motive power for &#7930;yn
Pair Mill, and that long-continued heavy rains followed.&rsquo; Then we
have the story related to Mr. Reynolds as to &#7930;yn y <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>Fan
Fach, how there emerged from the water a huge hairy fellow of hideous
aspect, who stormed at the disturbers of his peace, and uttered the
threat that unless they left him alone in his own place he would drown
a whole town. Thus the power of the water spirit is represented as
equal to producing excessive wet weather and destructive floods. He is
in all probability not to be dissociated from the afanc in the Conwy
story which has already been given (pp. 130&ndash;3). Now the local
belief is that the reason why the afanc had to be dragged out of the
river was that he caused floods in the river and made it impossible for
people to cross on their way to market at &#7930;anrwst. Some such a
local legend has been generalized into a sort of universal flood story
in the late Triad, iii. 97, as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Three masterpieces
of the Isle of Prydain: the Ship of Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, that
carried in her male and female of every kind when the Lake of
&#7930;&iuml;on burst; and Hu the Mighty&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Ychen
Bannog</i> dragging the afanc of the lake to land, so that the lake
burst no more; and the Stones of Gwy&#273;on Ganhebon, on which one
read all the arts and sciences of the world.&rsquo; A story similar to
the Conwy one, but no longer to be got so complete, as far as I know,
seems to have been current in various parts of the Principality,
especially around &#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on and on the banks of the
Anglesey pool called <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn yr Wyth Eidion</i>,
&lsquo;the Pool of the Eight Oxen,&rsquo; for so many is Hu represented
here as requiring in dealing with the Anglesey afanc. According to Mr.
Pughe of Aberdovey, the same feat was performed at &#7930;yn Barfog,
not, however, by Hu and his oxen, but by Arthur and his horse. To be
more exact the task may be here considered as done by Arthur
superseding Hu: see p. 142 above. That, however, is of no consequence
here, and I return to the afanc: the Fan Fach legend told to Mr.
Reynolds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>makes the lake ruler huge and hairy, hideous and
rough-spoken, but he expresses himself in human speech, in fact in two
lines of doggerel: see p. 19 above. On the other hand, the &#7930;yn
Cwm &#7930;wch story, which puts the same doggerel, p. 21, into the
mouth of the threatening figure in red who sits in a chair on the face
of that lake, suggests nothing abnormal about his personal appearance.
Then as to the Conwy afanc, he is very heavy, it is true, but he also
speaks the language of the country. He is lured, be it noticed, out of
his home in the lake by the attractions of a young woman, who lets him
rest his head in her lap and fall asleep. When he wakes to find himself
in chains he takes a cruel revenge on her. But with infinite toil and
labour he is dragged beyond the Conwy watershed into one of the highest
tarns on Snowdon; for there is here no question of killing him, but
only of removing him where he cannot harm the people of the Conwy
Valley. It is true that the story of Peredur represents that knight
cutting an afanc&rsquo;s head off, but so much the worse for the
compiler of that romance, as we have doubtless in the afanc some kind
of a deathless being. However, the description which the Peredur story
gives<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1428src" href="#xd26e1428" name=
"xd26e1428src">18</a> of him is interesting: he lives in a cave at the
door of which is a stone pillar: he sees everybody that comes without
anybody seeing him; and from behind the pillar he kills all comers with
a poisoned spear.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have the afanc described mostly from a hostile point of
view: let us change our position, which some of the stories already
given enable us to do. Take for instance the first of the whole series,
where it describes, p. 7, the Fan Fach youth&rsquo;s despair when the
lake damsel, whose love he had gained, suddenly dived to fetch her
father and her sister. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href=
"#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>There emerged, it says, out of the
lake two most beautiful ladies, accompanied by a hoary-headed man of
noble mien and extraordinary stature, but having otherwise all the
force and strength of youth. This hoary-headed man of noble mien owned
herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, a number of which were allowed to
come out of the lake to form his daughter&rsquo;s dowry, as the
narrative goes on to show. In the story of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r
Ar&#273;u, p. 32, he has a consort who appears with him to join in
giving the parental sanction to the marriage which their daughter was
about to make with the Snowdon shepherd. In neither of these stories
has this extraordinary figure any name given him, and it appears
<i lang="la">prima facie</i> probable that the term afanc is rather one
of abuse in harmony with the unlovely description of him supplied by
the other stories. But neither in them does the term <i lang="cy">yr
afanc</i> suit the monster meant, for there can be no doubt that in the
word afanc we have the etymological equivalent of the Irish word
<i lang="ga">abacc</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf&rsquo;; and till further light
is shed on these words one may assume that at one time afanc also meant
a dwarf or pigmy in Welsh. In modern Welsh it has been regarded as
meaning a beaver, but as that was too small an animal to suit the
popular stories, the word has been also gravely treated as meaning a
crocodile<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1447src" href="#xd26e1447" name=
"xd26e1447src">19</a>: this is in the teeth of the unanimous treatment
of him as anthropomorphic in the legends in point. If one is to abide
by the meaning dwarf or pigmy, one is bound to regard afanc as one of
the terms originally applied to the fairies in their more unlovely
aspects: compare the use of <i lang="cy">crimbil</i>, p. 263. Here may
also be mentioned <i lang="cy">pegor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf <span class=

<p class="first">I should rather suppose, then, that the pigmies in the
water-world were believed to consist of many grades or classes, and to
be innumerable like the Luchorp&aacute;in of Irish legend, which were
likewise regarded as diminutive. With the Luchorp&aacute;in were also
associated<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1556src" href="#xd26e1556" name=
"xd26e1556src">20</a> <i lang="ga">Fomori</i> or <i lang=
"ga">Fomoraig</i> (modern Irish spelling <i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>),
and <i lang="ga">Goborchinn</i>, &lsquo;Horse-heads.&rsquo; The
etymology of the word <i>Fomori</i> has been indicated at p. 286 above,
but Irish legendary history has long associated it with <i>muir</i>,
&lsquo;sea,&rsquo; genitive <i>mara</i>, Welsh <i lang="cy">mor</i>,
and it has gone so far as to see in them, as there suggested, not
submarine but transmarine enemies and invaders of Ireland. So the
singular <i lang="ga">fomor</i>, now written <i lang="ga">fomhor</i>,
is treated in O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <i>Irish Dictionary</i> as meaning
&lsquo;a pirate, a sea robber, a giant,&rsquo; while in Highland
Gaelic, where it is written <i>fomhair</i> or <i>famhair</i>, it is
regularly used as the word for giant. The Manx Gaelic corresponding to
Irish <i lang="ga">fomor</i> and its derivative <i lang=
"ga">fomorach</i>, is <i lang="ga">foawr</i>, &lsquo;a giant,&rsquo;
and <i lang="ga">foawragh</i>, &lsquo;gigantic,&rsquo; but also
&lsquo;a pirate.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href=
"#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>I remember hearing, however, years
ago, a mention made of the <i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>, which, without
conveying any definite allusion to their stature, associated them with
subterranean places:&mdash;An undergraduate from the neighbourhood of
Killorglin, in Kerry, happened to relate in my hearing, how, when he
was exploring some underground <i lang="ga">r&aacute;ths</i> near his
home, he was warned by his father&rsquo;s workmen to beware of the
<i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>. But on the borders of the counties of Mayo
and Sligo I have found the word used as in the Scottish Highlands,
namely, in the sense of giants, while Dr. Douglas Hyde and others
inform me that the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is called in Irish <i lang=
"ga">Cloch&aacute;n na bh-Fomhorach</i>.</p>
<p>The Goborchinns or Horse-heads have also an interest, not only in
connexion with the Fomori, as when we read of a king of the latter
called Eocha Eachcheann<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1635src" href=
"#xd26e1635" name="xd26e1635src">21</a>, or Eochy Horse-head, but also
as a link between the Welsh afanc and the Highland water-horse, of whom
Campbell has a good deal to say in his <i>Popular Tales of the West
Highlands</i>. See more especially iv. 337, where he remarks among
other things, that &lsquo;the water-horse assumes many shapes; he often
appears as a man,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;and sometimes as a large
bird.&rsquo; A page or two earlier he gives a story which illustrates
the statement, at the same time that it vividly reminds one of that
part of the Conwy legend which (p. 130) represents the afanc resting
his head on the lap of the damsel forming one of the <i lang=
"la">dramatis person&aelig;</i>. Here follows Campbell&rsquo;s own
story, omitting all about a marvellous bull, however, that was in the
end to checkmate the water-horse:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A long time after these things a servant girl went with the
farmer&rsquo;s herd of cattle to graze them at the side of a loch, and
she sat herself down near the bank. There, in a little while, what
should she see walking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href=
"#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>towards her but a man, who asked
her to <i>fasg</i> his hair [Welsh <i lang="cy">&#7931;eua</i>]. She
said she was willing enough to do him that service, and so he laid his
head on her knee, and she began to array his locks, as Neapolitan
damsels also do by their swains. But soon she got a great fright, for
growing amongst the man&rsquo;s hair, she found a great quantity of
<i lang="cy">liobhagach an locha</i>, a certain slimy green
weed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1664src" href="#xd26e1664" name=
"xd26e1664src">22</a> that abounds in such lochs, fresh, salt, and
brackish. The girl knew that if she screamed there was an end of her,
so she kept her terror to herself, and worked away till the man fell
asleep as he was with his head on her knee. Then she untied her apron
strings, and slid the apron quietly on to the ground with its burden
upon it, and then she took her feet home as fast as it was in her
heart<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1668src" href="#xd26e1668" name=
"xd26e1668src">23</a>. Now when she was getting near the houses, she
gave a glance behind her, and there she saw her <i lang="cy">caraid</i>
(friend) coming after her in the likeness of a horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The equine form belongs also more or less constantly to the kelpie
of the Lowlands of Scotland and of the Isle of Man, where we have him
in the glashtyn, whose amorous propensities are represented as more
repulsive than what appears in Welsh or Irish legend: see p. 289 above,
and the <i lang="cy">Lioar Manninagh</i> for 1897, p. 139. Perhaps in
Man and the Highlands the horsy nature of this being has been
reinforced by the influence of the Norse <i>Nykr</i>, a Northern
Proteus or old <i>Nick</i>, who takes many forms, but with a decided
preference for that of &lsquo;a gray water-horse&rsquo;: see
Vigfusson&rsquo;s <i>Icelandic-English Dictionary</i>. But the idea of
associating the equine form with the water divinity is by no means
confined to the Irish and the Northern nations: witness the Greek
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>legend of the horse being of Poseidon&rsquo;s
own creation, and the beast whose form he sometimes assumed.</p>
<p>It is in this sort of a notion of a water-horse one is probably to
look for the key to the riddle of such conceptions as that of March ab
Meirchion, the king with horse&rsquo;s ears, and the corresponding
Irish figure of Labraid Lorc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1692src" href=
"#xd26e1692" name="xd26e1692src">24</a>. In both of these the brute
peculiarities are reduced almost to a minimum: both are human in form
save their ears alone. The name <i>Labraid Lorc</i> is distinct enough
from the Welsh <i>March</i>, but under this latter name one detects
traces of him with the horse&rsquo;s ears in Wales, Cornwall, and
Brittany<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1723src" href="#xd26e1723" name=
"xd26e1723src">25</a>. We have also probably the same name in the
<i>Morc</i> of Irish legend: at any rate <i>Morc</i>, <i>Marc</i>, or
<i>Margg</i>, seems to be the same name as the Welsh <i>March</i>,
which is no other word than <i>march</i>, &lsquo;a steed or
charger.&rsquo; Now the Irish Morc is not stated to have had
horse&rsquo;s ears, but he and another called Conaing are represented
in the legendary history of early Erin as the naval leaders of the
Fomori, a sort of position which would seem to fit the Brythonic March
also were he to be treated in earnest as an historical character. But
short of that another treatment may be suspected of having been
actually dealt out to him, namely, that of resolving the water-horse
into a horse and his master. Of this we seem to have two instances in
the course of the story of the formation of Lough Neagh in the <i>Book
of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 39&ndash;41:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was once a good king named Maired reigning over Munster, and
he had two sons, Eochaid and Rib. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436"
href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>He married a wife named Ebliu
(genitive <i>Eblinde</i>), who fell in love with her stepson, Eochaid.
The two brothers make up their minds to leave their father and to take
Ebliu with them, together with all that was theirs, including in all a
thousand men. They proceed northwards, but their druids persuade them
that they cannot settle down in the same district, so Rib goes
westwards to a plain known as <i lang="cy">T&iacute;r Cluchi Midir acus
Maic &Oacute;ic</i>, &lsquo;the Play-ground of Mider and the Mac
&Oacute;c,&rsquo; so called after the two great fairy chiefs of
Ireland. Mider visits Rib&rsquo;s camp and kills their horses, then he
gives them a big horse of his own ready harnessed with a pack-saddle.
They had to put all their baggage on the big horse&rsquo;s back and go
away, but after a while the nag lay down and a well of water formed
there, which eventually burst forth, drowning them all: this is Loch
Ri, &lsquo;Rib&rsquo;s Loch, or Lough Ree,&rsquo; on the Shannon.
Eochaid, the other brother, went with his party to the banks of the
Boyne near the Brug, where the fairy chief Mac &Oacute;c or Mac ind
&Oacute;c had his residence: he destroyed Eochaid&rsquo;s horses the
first night, and the next day he threatened to destroy the men
themselves unless they went away. Thereupon Eochaid said that they
could not travel without horses, so the Mac &Oacute;c gave them a big
horse, on whose back they placed all they had. The Mac &Oacute;c warned
them not to unload the nag on the way, and not to let him halt lest he
should be their death. However, when they had reached the middle of
Ulster, they thoughtlessly took all their property off the
horse&rsquo;s back, and nobody bethought him of turning the
animal&rsquo;s head back in the direction from which they had come: so
he also made a well<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1764src" href=
"#xd26e1764" name="xd26e1764src">26</a>. Over that well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>Eochaid had a house built, and a lid put on the
well, which he set a woman to guard. In the sequel she neglected it,
and the well burst forth and formed Lough Neagh, as already mentioned,
p. 382 above. What became of the big horses in these stories one is not
told, but most likely they were originally represented as vanishing in
a spring of water where each of them stood. Compare the account of
Undine at her unfaithful husband&rsquo;s funeral. In the procession she
mysteriously appeared as a snow-white figure deeply veiled, but when
one rose from kneeling at the grave, where she had knelt nought was to
be seen save a little silver spring of limpid water bubbling out of the
turf and trickling on to surround the new grave:&mdash;<i lang="de">Da
man sich aber wieder erhob, war die weisse Fremde verschwunden; an der
Stelle, wo sie geknieet hatte, quoll ein silberhelles Br&uuml;nnlein

Grabh&uuml;gel des Ritters fast ganz umzogen hatte; dann rann es
f&uuml;rder und ergoss sich in einen Weiher, der zur Seite des
Gottesackers lag</i>.</p>
<p>The late and grotesque story of the Gilla Decair may be mentioned
next: he was one of the Fomorach, and had a wonderful kind of horse on
whose back most of Finn&rsquo;s chief warriors were induced to mount.
Then the Gilla Decair and his horse hurried towards Corkaguiny, in
Kerry, and took to the sea, for he and his horse travelled equally well
on sea and land. Thus Finn&rsquo;s men, unable to dismount, were
carried prisoners to an island not named, on which Dermot in quest of
them afterwards landed, and from which, after great perils, he made his
way to T&iacute;r fo Thuinn, &lsquo;Terra sub Unda,&rsquo; and brought
his friends back to Erin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1793src" href=
"#xd26e1793" name="xd26e1793src">27</a>. Now the number <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>of
Finn&rsquo;s men taken away by force by the Gilla Decair was fifteen,
fourteen on the back of his horse and one clutching to the
animal&rsquo;s tail, and the Welsh Triads, i. 93 = ii. 11, seem to
re-echo some similar story, but they give the number of persons not as
fifteen but just one half, and describe the horse as Du (y)
Moroe&#273;, &lsquo;the Black of (the) Seas,&rsquo; steed of Elidyr
Mwynfawr, that carried seven human beings and a half from Pen
&#7930;ech Elidyr in the North to Pen &#7930;ech Elidyr in M&ocirc;n,
&lsquo;Anglesey.&rsquo; It is explained that Du carried seven on his
back, and that one who swam with his hands on that horse&rsquo;s
crupper was reckoned the half man in this case. Du Moroe&#273; is in
the story of Kulhwch and Olwen called Du March Moro, &lsquo;Black the
Steed of Moro,&rsquo; the horse ridden in the hunt of Twrch Trwyth by
Gwyn ab Nu&#273;, king of the other world; and he appears as a knight
with his name unmistakably rendered into Brun de Morois in the romance
of Durmart le Galois, who carries away Arthur&rsquo;s queen on his
horse to his castle in Morois<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1801src" href=
"#xd26e1801" name="xd26e1801src">28</a>. Lastly, here also might be
mentioned the incident in the story of Peredur or Perceval, which
relates how to that knight, when he was in the middle of a forest much
distressed for the want of a horse, a lady brought a fine steed as
black as a blackberry. He mounted and he found his beast marvellously
swift, but on his making straight for a vast river the knight made the
sign of the cross, whereupon he was left on the ground, and his horse
plunged into the water, which his touch seemed to set ablaze. The horse
is interpreted to have been the devil<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1810src" href="#xd26e1810" name="xd26e1810src">29</a>, and this
is a fair specimen of the way in which Celtic paganism is treated by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>Grail writers when they feel in the humour to
assume an edifying attitude.</p>
<p>If one is right in setting M&ocirc;n, &lsquo;Anglesey,&rsquo; over
against the anonymous isle to which the Gilla Decair hurries
Finn&rsquo;s men away, Anglesey would have to be treated as having once
been considered one of the Islands of the Dead and the home of
Other-world inhabitants. We have a trace of this in a couplet in a poem
by the medieval poet, Dafy&#273; ab Gwilym, who makes Blodeuwe&#273;
the Owl give a bit of her history as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">This, it will be seen, connects March ab Meirchion, as
it were &lsquo;Steed son of Steeding,&rsquo; with the Isle of Anglesey.
Add to this that the Irish for Anglesey or Mona was <i lang=
"cy">M&oacute;in Conaing</i>, &lsquo;Conaing&rsquo;s Swamp,&rsquo; so
called apparently after Conaing associated with Morc, a name which is
practically <i>March</i> in Welsh. Both were leaders of the Fomori in
Irish tales: see my <i>Arthurian Legend</i>, p. 356.</p>
<p>On the great place given to islands in Celtic legend and myth it is
needless here to expatiate: witness <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>Brittia, to which
Procopius describes the souls of the departed being shipped from the

Merlin and his retinue enter the Glass House<a class="noteref" id=

"xd26e1927src" href="#xd26e1927" name="xd26e1927src">32</a>.</p>
<p>Let us return to the more anthropomorphic figure of the afanc, and
take as his more favoured representative the virile personage described
emerging from the Fan Fach Lake to give his sanction to the marriage of
his daughter with the My&#273;fai shepherd. It is probable that a
divinity of the same order belonged to every other lake of any
considerable dimensions in the country. But it will be remembered that
in the case of the story of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u two parents
appeared with the lake maiden&mdash;her father and her mother&mdash;and
we may suppose that they were divinities of the water-world. The same
thing also may be inferred from the late Triad, iii. 13, which speaks
of the bursting of the lake of &#7930;&iuml;on, causing all the lands
to be inundated so that all the human race was drowned except Dwyfan
and Dwyfach, who escaped in a mastless ship: it was from them that the
island of Prydain was repeopled. A similar Triad, iii. 97, but
evidently of a different origin, has already been mentioned as speaking
of the Ship of Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, that carried in it a male and
female of every kind when the lake of &#7930;&iuml;on burst. This later
Triad evidently supplies what had been forgotten in the previous one,
namely, a pair of each kind of animal life, and not of mankind alone.
But from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>names Dwyfan and Dwyfach I infer that the writer
of Triad iii. 13 has developed his universal deluge on the basis of the
scriptural account of it, for those names belonged in all probability
to wells and rivers: in other terms, they were the names of water
divinities. At any rate there seems to be some evidence that two
springs, whose waters flow into Bala Lake, were at one time called
Dwyfan and Dwyfach, these names being borne both by the springs
themselves and the rivers flowing from them. The Dwyfan and the Dwyfach
were regarded as uniting in the lake, while the water on its issuing
from the lake is called Dyfrdwy. Now <i lang="cy">Dyfrdwy</i> stands
for an older <i lang="cy">Dyfr-dwyf</i>, which in Old Welsh was
<i lang="cy">Dubr duiu</i>, &lsquo;the water of the divinity.&rsquo;
One of the names of that divinity was <i>Donwy</i>, standing for an
early form <i>Danuvios</i> or <i>Danuvia</i>, according as it was
masculine or feminine. In either case it was practically the same name
as that of the <i>Danube</i> or <i>Danuvios</i>, derived from a word
which is represented in Irish by the adjective <i>d&aacute;na</i>,
&lsquo;<span lang="la">audax, fortis, intrepidus</span>.&rsquo; The Dee
has in Welsh poetry still another name, Aerfen, which seems to mean a
martial goddess or the spirit of the battlefield, which is corroborated
and explained by Giraldus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1969src" href=
"#xd26e1969" name="xd26e1969src">33</a>, who represents the river as
the accredited arbiter of the fortunes of the wars in its country
between the Welsh and the English. The name Dyfrdonwy occurs in a poem
by &#7930;ywarch Brydy&#273; y Moch, a poet who flourished towards the
end of the twelfth century, as follows<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The prince praised was &#7930;ywelyn ab Iorwerth, whom the poet

probable by the fact that Ptolemy elsewhere gives it as the name of the
northern Dee, which enters the sea near Aberdeen. From the same stem
were formed the names Dwyf-an and Dwyf-ach, which are treated in the
Triads as masculine and feminine respectively. In its course the Welsh
Dee receives a river Ceirw not far above Corwen, and that river flows
through farms called Ar-&#273;wyfan and Hendre&rsquo; Ar-&#273;wyfan,
and adjoining Ar&#273;wyfan is another farm called Foty Ar&#273;wyfan,
&lsquo;Shielings of Ar&#273;wyfan,&rsquo; while Hendre&rsquo;
Ar&#273;wyfan means the old stead or winter abode of Ar&#273;wyfan.
Ar&#273;wyfan itself would seem to mean &lsquo;On Dwyfan,&rsquo; and
Hendre&rsquo; Ar&#273;wyfan, which may be supposed the original
homestead, stands near a burn which flows into the Ceirw. That burn I
should suppose to have been the Dwyfan, and perhaps the name extended
to the Ceirw itself; but Dwyfan is not now known as the name
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>of any stream in the neighbourhood. Elsewhere we
have two rivers called Dwyfor or Dwyfawr and Dwyfach, which unite a
little below the village of &#7930;an Ystumdwy; and from there to the
sea, the stream is called Dwyfor, the mouth of which is between
Criccieth and Afon Wen, in Carnarvonshire. Ystumdwy, commonly corrupted
into Stindwy, seems to mean <i lang="cy">Ystum-dwy</i>, &lsquo;the bend
of the Dwy&rsquo;; so that here also we have Dwyfach and Dwy, as in the
case of the Dee. Possibly Dwyfor was previously called simply Dwy or
even Dwyfan; but it is now explained as <i lang="cy">Dwy-fawr</i>,
&lsquo;great Dwy,&rsquo; which was most likely suggested by Dwyfach, as
this latter explains itself to the country people as <i lang=
"cy">Dwy-fach</i>, &lsquo;little Dwy.&rsquo; However, it is but right
to say that in &#7930;ywelyn ab Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s grant of lands to
the monks of Aber Conwy they seem to be called Dwyuech and
Dwyuaur<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2089src" href="#xd26e2089" name=
"xd26e2089src">37</a>.</p>
<p>All these waters have in common the reputation of being liable to
sudden and dangerous floods, especially the Dwyfor, which drains Cwm
Stra&#7931;yn and its lake lying behind the great rocky barrier on the
left as one goes from Tremadoc towards Aber Glaslyn Bridge. Still more
so is this the case with the Dee and Bala Lake, which is wont to rise
at times from seven to nine feet above its ordinary level. The
inundation which then invades the valley from Bala down presents a
sight more magnificent than comfortable to contemplate. In fact nothing
could have been more natural than for the story elaborated by the
writer of certain of the late Triads to have connected the most
remarkable inundations with the largest piece of water in the
Principality, and one liable to such sudden changes of level: in other
words, that one should treat &#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on as merely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>one of the names of Bala Lake, now called in
Welsh &#7930;yn Tegid, and formerly sometimes &#7930;yn Aerfen.</p>
<p>While touching at p. 286 on Gwaen &#7930;ifon with its &#7930;yn
Pencraig as one of those claiming to be the &#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on
of the Triads, it was hinted that <i lang="cy">&#7930;&iuml;on</i> was
but a thinner form of <i lang="cy">&#7930;ifon</i>. Here one might
mention perhaps another &#7930;ifon, for which, however, no case could
be made. I allude to the name of the residence of the Wynns descended
from Gilmin Troed&#273;u, namely, Glyn &#7930;ifon, which means the
river &#7930;ifon&rsquo;s Glen; but one could not feel surprised if the
neighbouring &#7930;yfni, draining the lakes of Nant&#7931;e, should
prove to have once been also known as a &#7930;ifon, with the
Nant&#7931;e waters conforming by being called &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon.
But however that may be, one may say as to the flood caused by the
bursting of any such lake, that the notion of the universality of the
catastrophe was probably contributed by the author of Triad iii. 13,
from a non-Welsh source. He may have, however, not invented the vessel
in which he places Dwyfan and Dwyfach: at all events, one version of
the story of the Fan Fach represents the Lake Lady arriving in a boat.
As to the writer of the other Triad, iii. 97, he says nothing about
Dwyfan and his wife, but borrows Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion&rsquo;s ship to
save all that were to be saved; and here one may probably venture to
identify <i lang="cy">Nefy&#273;</i> with <i>Nemed</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2118src" href="#xd26e2118" name=
"xd26e2118src">38</a>, genitive <i>Nemid</i>, a name borne in Irish
legend by a rover who is represented as one of the early colonizers of
Erin. As to the rest, the name Neifion by itself is used in Welsh for
Neptune and the sea, as in the following couplet of D. ab
Gwilym&rsquo;s poem lv:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Nofiad a wnaeth hen Neifion</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>O Droia fawr draw i F&ocirc;n.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">It is old Neptune that has swam</p>
<p class="line">From great Troy afar to Mona.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the same way <i lang="cy">M&ocirc;r Neifion</i>, &lsquo;Sea of
Neifion,&rsquo; seems to have signified the ocean, the high seas.</p>
<p>To return to the Triad about Dwyfan and Dwyfach, not only does it
make them from being water divinities into a man and woman, but there
is no certainty even that both were not feminine. In modern Welsh all
rivers are treated as feminine, and even Dyfrdwyf has usually to
submit, though the modern bard Tegid, analysing the word into <i lang=
"cy">Dwfr Dwyf</i>, &lsquo;Water of the Divinity or Divine
Water,&rsquo; where <i lang="cy">dwfr</i>, &lsquo;water,&rsquo; could
only be masculine, addressed &#7930;yn Tegid thus, p. 78:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Drwyot, er dy&#273;iau&rsquo;r Drywon,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Y rhwyf y Dyfrdwyf ei don.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Through thee, from the days of the Druids,</p>
<p class="line">The Dwfr Dwyf impels his wave.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This question, however, of the gender of river names,
or rather the sex which personification ascribed them, is a most
difficult one. If we glance at Ptolemy&rsquo;s Geography written in the
second century, we find in his account of the British Isles that he
names more than fifty of our river mouths and estuaries, and that he
divides their names almost equally into masculine and feminine. The
modern Welsh usage has, it is seen, departed far from this, but not so
far the folklore: the afanc is a male, and we have a figure of the same
sex appearing as the father of the lake maiden in the Fan Fach story,
and in that of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u; the same, too, was the
sex of the chief dweller of &#7930;yn Cwm &#7930;wch; the same remark
is applicable also to the greatest divinity of these islands&mdash;the
greatest, at any rate, so far as the scanty traces of his cult enable
one to become acquainted with him. As his name comes down into legend
it belongs here, as well as to the deities of antiquity, just as much,
in a sense, as the Dee. I refer to Nudons or Nodons, the
remains<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2173src" href="#xd26e2173" name=
"xd26e2173src">39</a> of whose sanctuary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb446" href="#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>were many years ago
brought to light on a pleasant hill in Lydney Park, on the western
banks of the Severn. In the mosaic floor of the god&rsquo;s temple
there is a coloured inscription showing the expense of that part of the
work to have been defrayed by the contributions (<i lang="la">ex
stipibus</i>) of the faithful, and that it was carried out by two men,
of whom one appears to have been an officer in command of a naval force
guarding the coasts of the Severn Sea. In the midst of the mosaic
inscription is a round opening in the floor of nine inches in diameter
and surrounded by a broad band of red enclosed in two of blue. This has
given rise to various speculations, and among others that it was
intended for libations. The mosaics and the lettering of the
inscriptions seem to point to the third century as the time when the
sanctuary of Nudons was built under Roman auspices, though the place
was doubtless sacred to the god long before. In any case it fell in
exactly with the policy of the more astute of Roman statesmen to
encourage such a native cult as we find traces of in Lydney Park.</p>
<p>One of the inscriptions began with D. M. Nodonti, &lsquo;to the
great god Nudons,&rsquo; and a little bronze crescent intended for the
diadem of the god or of one of his priests gives a representation of
him as a crowned, beardless personage driving a chariot with four
horses; and on either side of him is a naked figure supposed to
represent the winds, and beyond them on each of the two sides is a
triton with the fore feet of a horse. The god holds the reins in his
left hand, and his right uplifted grasps what may be a sceptre or
possibly a whip, while the whole equipment of the god recalls in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>some measure the Chariot of the Sun. Another
piece of the bronze ornament shows another triton with an anchor in one
of his hands, and opposite him a fisherman in the act of hooking a fine
salmon. Other things, such as oars and shell trumpets, together with
mosaic representations of marine animals in the floor of the temple,
compel us to assimilate Nudons more closely with Neptune than any other
god of classical mythology.</p>
<p>The name of the god, as given in the inscriptions, varies between
Nudons and Nodens, the cases actually occurring being the dative
Nodonti, Nodenti, and Nudente, and the genitive Nodentis, so I should
regard <i>&#333;</i> or <i>&#363;</i> as optional in the first
syllable, and <i>o</i> as preferable, perhaps, to <i>e</i> in the
second, for there is no room for reasonably doubting that we have here
to do with the same name as Irish <i>Nuadu</i>, genitive <i>Nuadat</i>,
conspicuous in the legendary history of Ireland. Now the Nuadu who
naturally occurs to one first, was Nuadu Argetl&aacute;m or Nuadu of
the Silver Hand, from <i>argat</i>, &lsquo;silver, <i lang=
"la">argentum</i>,&rsquo; and <i>l&aacute;m</i>, &lsquo;hand.&rsquo;
Irish literature explains how he came to have a hand made of silver,
and we can identify with him on Welsh ground a &#7930;u&#273;
&#7930;awereint; for put back as it were into earlier Brythonic, this
would be <i lang="cy">L&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;m&rsquo;-argenti&#815;os</i>: that is to say, a reversal takes
place in the order of the elements forming the epithet out of
<i>ereint</i> (for older <i>ergeint</i>), &lsquo;silvern,
<i>argenteus</i>,&rsquo; and <i>&#7931;aw</i>, for earlier
<i>l&#257;ma</i>, &lsquo;hand.&rsquo; Then comes the alliterative
instinct into play, forcing <i>N&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;margenti&#815;o(s)</i> to become <i>L&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;margenti&#815;o(s)</i>, whence the later form, <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;u&#273; &#7930;awereint</i>, derives regularly<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2253src" href="#xd26e2253" name=
"xd26e2253src">40</a>. Thus we have in Welsh the name <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;&ucirc;&#273;</i>, fashioned into that form under the
influence of the epithet, whereas elsewhere it is <i lang=
"cy">N&ucirc;&#273;</i>, which occurs as a man&rsquo;s name in the
pedigrees, while an intermediate form was probably <i>N&#363;dos</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span>or <i>N&#363;do</i>, of which a genitive
<i>NVDI</i> occurs in a post-Roman inscription found near Yarrow Kirk
in Selkirkshire. It is worthy of note that the modification of
<i>N&#363;do</i> into <i>L&#363;do</i> must have taken place
comparatively early&mdash;not improbably while the language was still
Goidelic&mdash;as we seem to have a survival of the name in that of
<i>Lydney</i> itself.</p>
<p>It is very possible that we have <i>L&#363;do</i>, &#7930;u&#273;,
also in <i>Porthlu&#273;</i>; which Geoffrey of Monmouth gives, iii.
20, as the Welsh for Ludesgata or Ludgate, in London, which gate,
according to him, was called after an ancient king of Britain named
Lud. He seems to have been using an ancient tradition, and there would
be nothing improbable in the conjecture that Geoffrey&rsquo;s Lud was
our &#7930;u&#273;, and that the great water divinity of that name had
another sanctuary on the hill by the Thames, somewhere near the present
site of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and occupying a post as it were
prophetic of Britain&rsquo;s rule of the water-ways in later times.</p>
<p>Perhaps as one seems to find traces of Nudons from the estuary of
the Thames to that of the Severn and thence to Ireland, one may
conclude that the god was one of the divinities worshipped by the
Goidels. With regard to the Brythonic Celts, there is nothing to
suggest that he belonged also to them except in the sense of his having
been probably adopted by them from the Goidels. It might be further
suggested that the Goidels themselves had in the first instance adopted
him from the pre-Celtic natives, but in that case a goddess would have
been rather more probable<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2296src" href=
"#xd26e2296" name="xd26e2296src">41</a>. In fact in the case of the
Severn we seem to have a trace of such a goddess in the Sabrina, Old
Welsh Habren, now Hafren, so called after a princess whom Geoffrey, ii.
5, represents drowned in the river: she may have been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span>the
pre-Celtic goddess of the Severn, and the name corresponding to Welsh
Hafren occurs in Ireland in the form of Sabrann, an old name of the
river Lee that flows through Cork. Similarly one now reads sometimes of
<i>Father</i> Thames after the fashion of classic phraseology, and in
the Celtic period Nudons may have been closely identified with that
river, but the ancient name T&#259;m&#275;sa or
T&#259;m&#275;sis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2307src" href="#xd26e2307"
name="xd26e2307src">42</a> was decidedly feminine, and it was, most
likely, that of the river divinity from times when the pre-Celtic
natives held exclusive possession of these islands. On the whole it
appears safer to regard Nudons as belonging to a race that had
developed on a larger scale the idea of a patriarchal or kingly ruler
holding sway over a comparatively wide area. So Nudons may here be
treated as ruled out of the discussion as to the origin of the fairies,
to which a few paragraphs are now to be devoted.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rank and file of the fairies in rather a promiscuous
fashion, one may say that we have found manifold proof of their close
connexion with the water-world. Not only have we found them supposed to
haunt places bordering on rivers, to live beneath the lakes, or to
inhabit certain green isles capable of playing hide-and-seek with the
ancient mariner, and perhaps not so very ancient either; but other
considerations have been suggested as also pointing unmistakably to the
same conclusion. Take for instance the indirect evidence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>afforded by the method of proceeding to recover
an infant stolen by the fairies. One account runs thus: The mother who
had lost her baby was to go with a wizard and carry with her to a river
the child left her in exchange. The wizard would say, <i lang="cy">Crap
ar y wrach</i>, &lsquo;Grip the hag,&rsquo; and the woman would reply,
<i lang="cy">Rhy hwyr, gyfraglach</i>, &lsquo;Too late, you
urchin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2354src" href="#xd26e2354" name=
"xd26e2354src">43</a>.&rsquo; Before she uttered those words she had
dropped the urchin into the river, and she would then return to her
house. By that time the kidnapped child would be found to have come
back home<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2372src" href="#xd26e2372" name=
"xd26e2372src">44</a>. The words here used have not been quite
forgotten in Carnarvonshire, but no distinct meaning seems to be
attached to them now; at any rate I have failed to find anybody who
could explain them. I should however guess that the wizard addressed
his words to the fairy urchin with the intention, presumably, that the
fairies in the river should at the same time hear and note what was
about to be done. Another, and a somewhat more intelligible version, is
given in the <i lang="cy">Gwyliedy&#273;</i> for 1837, p. 185, by a
contributor who publishes it from a manuscript which Lewis Morris began
to write in 1724 and finished apparently in 1729. He was a native of
Anglesey, and it is probably to that county the story belongs, which he
gives to illustrate one of the phonological aspects of certain kinds of
Welsh. That account differs from the one just cited in that it
introduces no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>wizard, but postulates two fairy urchins between
whom the dialogue occurs, which is not unusual in our changeling
stories: see p. 62. After this explanation I translate Morris&rsquo;
words thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But to return to the question of the words approaching to the
nature of the thing intended, there is an old story current among us
concerning a woman whose children had been exchanged by the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Whether it is truth or falsehood does not much
matter, yet it shows what the men of that age thought concerning the
sound of words, and how they fancied that the language of those sprites
was of a ghastly and lumpy kind. The story is as follows:&mdash;The
woman whose two children had been exchanged, chanced to overhear the
two <span class="corr" id="xd26e2392" title="Source: fair">fairy</span>
heirs, whom she got instead of them, reasoning with one another beyond
what became their age and persons. So she picked up the two sham
children, one under each arm, in order to go and throw them from a
bridge into a river, that they might be drowned as she fancied. But
hardly had the one in his fall reached the bottom when he cried out to
his comrade in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Grippiach greppiach</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Dal d&rsquo;afel yn y wrach,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Hi aeth yn rhowyr &rsquo;faglach&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mi eis i ir mwthlach<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2412src" href="#xd26e2412" name=
"xd26e2412src">45</a>.&rsquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Grippiach Greppiach,</p>
<p class="line">Keep thy hold on the hag.</p>
<p class="line">It got too late, thou urchin&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">I fell into the&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">In spite of the obscurity of these words, it is quite
clear that it was thought the most natural thing in the world to return
the fairies to the river, and no sooner were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name="pb452">452</a>]</span>they
dropped there than the right infants were found to have been sent
home.</p>
<p>The same thing may be learned also from the story of the Curse of
Pantannas, pp. 187&ndash;8 above; for when the time of the
fairies&rsquo; revenge is approaching, the merry party gathered
together at Pantannas are frightened by a piercing voice rising from a
black and cauldron-like pool in the river; and after a while they hear
it a second time rising above the noise of the river as it cascades
over the shoulder of a neighbouring rock. Shortly afterwards an ugly,
diminutive woman appears on the table near the window, and had it not
been for the rudeness of one of those present she would have disclosed
the future to them, but, as it was, she said very little in a vague way
and went away offended; but as long as she was there the voice from the
river was silent. Here we have the Welsh counterpart of the <i>ben
s&iacute;de</i>, pronounced <i>banshee</i> in Anglo-Irish, and meaning
a fairy woman who is supposed to appear to certain Irish families
before deaths or other misfortunes about to befall them. It is
doubtless to some such fairy persons the voices belong, which threaten
vengeance on the heir of Pantannas and on the wicked prince and his
descendants previous to the cataclysm which brings a lake into the
place of a doomed city: witness such cases as those of &#7930;ynclys,
Syfa&#273;on, and Kenfig.</p>
<p>The last mentioned deserves some further scrutiny; and I take this
opportunity of referring the reader back to pp. 403&ndash;4, in order
to direct his attention to the fact that the voice so closely
identifies itself with the wronged family that it speaks in the first
person, as it cries, &lsquo;Vengeance is come on him who murdered my
father of the ninth generation!&rsquo; Now it is worthy of remark that
the same personifying is also characteristic of the Cyhiraeth<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2461src" href="#xd26e2461" name=
"xd26e2461src">46</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href=
"#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span>This spectral female used to be
oftener heard than seen; but her blood-freezing shriek was as a rule to
be heard when she came to a cross-road or to water, in which she
splashed with her hands. At the same time she would make the most
doleful noise and exclaim, in case the frightened hearer happened to be
a wife, <i lang="cy">Fy ngwr, fy ngwr!</i> &lsquo;my husband, my
husband!&rsquo; If it was the man the exclamation would be, <i lang=
"cy">Fy ngwraig, fy ngwraig!</i> &lsquo;my wife, my wife!&rsquo; Or in
either case it might be, <i lang="cy">Fy mhlentyn, fy mhlentyn, fy
mhlentyn bach!</i> &lsquo;my child, my child, my little child!&rsquo;
These cries meant the approaching death of the hearer&rsquo;s husband,
wife, or child, as the case might be; but if the scream was
inarticulate it was reckoned probable that the hearer himself was the
person foremourned. Sometimes she was supposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>come, like the Irish banshee, in a dark mist to
the window of a person who has been long ailing, and to flap her wings
against the glass, while repeating aloud his or her name, which was
believed to mean that the patient must die<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2568src" href="#xd26e2568" name="xd26e2568src">47</a>. The
picture usually given of the Cyhiraeth is of the most repellent kind:
tangled hair, long black teeth, wretched, skinny, shrivelled arms of
unwonted length out of all proportion to the body. Nevertheless it is,
in my opinion, but another aspect of the banshee-like female who
intervenes in the story of the Curse of Pantannas. One might perhaps
treat both as survivals of a belief in a sort of personification of, or
divinity identified with, a family or tribe, but for the fact that such
language is emptied of most of its meaning by the abstractions which it
would connect with a primitive state of society. So it is preferable,
as coming probably near the truth, to say that what we have here is a
trace of an ancestress. Such an idea of an ancestress as against that
of an ancestor is abundantly countenanced by dim figures like that of
the D&ocirc;n of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and of her counterpart, after
whom the Tribes of the goddess Donu or Danu<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2577src" href="#xd26e2577" name="xd26e2577src">48</a> are known
as <i lang="cy">Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i> in Irish literature. But
the one who most provokes comparison is the Old Woman of Beare, already
mentioned, pp. 393&ndash;4: she figures largely in Irish folklore as a
hag surviving to see her descendants reckoned by tribes and peoples. It
may be only an accident that a poetically wrought legend pictures her
not so much interested in the fortunes of her progeny as engaged in
bewailing the unattractive appearance of her thin arms and shrivelled
hands, together with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href=
"#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>general wreck of the beauty which
had been hers some time or other centuries before.</p>
<p>However, the evidence of folklore is not of a kind to warrant our
building any heavy superstructure of theory on the supposition, that
the foundations are firmly held together by a powerful sense of
consistency or homogeneity. So I should hesitate to do anything so rash
as to pronounce the fairies to be all of one and the same origin: they
may well be of several. For instance, there may be those that have
grown out of traditions about an aboriginal pre-Celtic race, and some
may be the representatives of the ghosts of departed men and women,
regarded as one&rsquo;s ancestors; but there can hardly be any doubt
that others, and those possibly not the least interesting, have
originated in the demons and divinities&mdash;not all of ancestral
origin&mdash;with which the weird fancy of our remote forefathers
peopled lakes and streams, bays and creeks and estuaries. Perhaps it is
not too much to hope that the reader is convinced that in the course of
this chapter some interesting specimens have, so to say, been caught in
their native element, or else in the enjoyment of an amphibious life of
mirth and frolic, largely spent hard by sequestered lakes, near placid
rivers or babbling brooks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href=

Frenni Fach was convinced, when his senses and his memory returned,
that, &lsquo;although he thought he had been absent so many years, he
had been only so many minutes.&rsquo; The story has the ordinary
setting; but can it be of popular origin? The Frenni Fach is a part of

<i lang="cy">brenin</i>, &lsquo;king,&rsquo; qualified by an adjective
mutated feminine; but people at a distance who call it Frenni Fawr,
pronounce the former vocable with <i>nn</i>. Lastly, <i lang="cy">Y

dictionary makers have taken into their heads to treat it as
<i>Tam&#277;sis</i> I know not. The Welsh is <i>Tafwys</i> with a
diphthong regularly representing an earlier long <i>e</i> or <i>ei</i>
in the second syllable. There is, as far as I know, no reason to
suppose <i>Tafwys</i> an invention, rather than a genuine vocable of
the same origin as the name of the Glamorganshire river <i>Taff</i>, in
Welsh <i>Taf</i>, which is also the name of the river emptying itself
at Laugharne, in Carmarthenshire. <i>Tafwys</i>, however, does not
appear to occur in any old Welsh document; but no such weakness
attaches to the testimony of the French <i>Tamise</i>, which could
hardly come from <i>Tam&#277;sis</i>: compare also the place-name
<i>Tamise</i> near the Scheldt in East Flanders; this, however, may be
of a wholly different origin.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

is all of a heap, so to say. Pughe gives <i lang="cy">mwythlan</i> and
<i lang="cy">mwythlen</i> with similar significations. But <i lang=

doggerel as that of rough ground or a place covered with a scrubby,
tangled growth. It is possibly the same word as the Irish <i lang=

Howells, pp. 31&ndash;4, 56&ndash;7, who appears to have got uncertain
in his narrative as to the sex of the Cyhiraeth; but there is no reason
whatsoever for regarding it as either male or female&mdash;the latter
alone is warranted, as he might have gathered from her being called
<i lang="cy">y Gyhiraeth</i>, &lsquo;the Cyhiraeth,&rsquo; never
<i lang="cy">y Cyhiraeth</i> as far as I know. In North Cardiganshire
the spectre intended is known only by another name, that of <i lang=
"cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>, but <i lang="cy">y Gyhiraeth</i> or <i lang=
"cy">yr hen Gyhiraeth</i> is a common term of abuse applied to a lanky,
cadaverous person, both there and in Gwyne&#273;; in books, however, it
is found sometimes meaning a phantom funeral. The word <i lang=
"cy">cyhiraeth</i> would seem to have originally meant a skeleton with
<i lang="cy">cyhyrau</i>, &lsquo;sinews,&rsquo; but no flesh. However,
<i lang="cy">cyhyrau</i>, singular <i lang="cy">cyhyr</i>, would be
more correctly written with an <i>i</i>; for the words are
pronounced&mdash;even in Gwyne&#273;&mdash;<i lang="cy">cyhir</i>,
<i lang="cy">cyhirau</i>. The spelling <i lang="cy">cyhyraeth</i>
corresponds to no pronunciation I have ever heard of the word; but
there is a third spelling, <i lang="cy">cyheuraeth</i>, which
corresponds to an actual <i lang="cy">cyhoereth</i> or <i lang=
"cy">cyhoyreth</i>, the colloquial pronunciation to be heard in parts
of South Wales: I cannot account for this variant. <i lang="cy">Gwrach
y Rhibyn</i> means the Hag of the <i lang="cy">Rhibyn</i>, and <i lang=
"cy">rhibyn</i> usually means a row, streak, a line&mdash;<i lang=
"cy">ma&rsquo; nhw&rsquo;n mynd yn un rhibyn</i>, &lsquo;they are going
in a line.&rsquo; But what exactly <i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>
should connote I am unable to say. I may mention, however, on the
authority of Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, that in Mid-Cardiganshire the term
<i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i> means a long roll or bustle of fern
tied with ropes of straw and placed along the middle of the top of a
hayrick. This is to form a ridge over which and on which the thatch is
worked and supported: <i lang="cy">gwrach</i> unqualified is, I am
told, used in this sense in Glamorganshire. Something about the
<i lang="cy">Gwrach</i> sprite will be found in the <i>Brython</i> for
1860, p. 23<sup>a</sup>, while a different account is given in

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In previous chapters sundry allusions have been made
to treasure caves besides that of Marchlyn Mawr, which has been given
at length on pp. 234&ndash;7 above. Here follow some more, illustrative
of this kind of folklore prevalent in Wales: they are difficult to
classify, but most of them mention treasure with or without sleeping
warriors guarding it. The others are so miscellaneous as to baffle any
attempt to characterize them generally and briefly. Take for instance a
cave in the part of Rhiwarth rock nearest to Cwm &#7930;anhafan, in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;angynog in Montgomeryshire. Into that,
according to Cyn&#273;elw in the <i>Brython</i> for 1860, p. 57, some
men penetrated as far as the pound of candles lasted, with which they
had provided themselves; but it appears to be tenanted by a hag who is
always busily washing clothes in a brass pan.</p>
<p>Or take the following, from J. H. Roberts&rsquo; essay, as given in
Welsh in Edwards&rsquo; <i lang="cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, p. 190: it
reminds one of an ordinary fairy tale, but it is not quite like any
other which I happen to know:&mdash;In the western end of the Arennig
Fawr there is a cave: in fact there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb457" href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span>are several caves
there, and some of them are very large too; but there is one to which
the finger of tradition points as an ancient abode of the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. About two generations ago, the shepherds of that
country used to be enchanted by one of them called Mary, who was
remarkable for her beauty. Many an effort was made to catch her or to
meet her face to face, but without success, as she was too quick on her
feet. She used to show herself day after day, and she might be seen,
with her little harp, climbing the bare slopes of the mountain. In
misty weather when the days were longest in summer, the music she made
used to be wafted by the breeze to the ears of the love-sick shepherds.
Many a time had the boys of the Fi&#7931;tir Gerrig heard sweet singing
when passing the cave in the full light of day, but they were subject
to some spell, so that they never ventured to enter. But the shepherd
of Boch y Rhaiadr had a better view of the fairies one Allhallows night
(<i lang="cy">ryw noson <span class="corr" id="xd26e2627" title=
"Source: Galangaeaf">Calangaeaf</span></i>) when returning home from a
merry-making at Amno&#273;. On the sward in front of the cave what
should he see but scores of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> singing
and dancing! He never saw another assembly in his life so fair, and
great was the trouble he had to resist being drawn into their
circles.</p>
<p>Let us now come to the treasure caves, and begin with <i>Ogof
Arthur</i>, &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cave,&rsquo; in the southern side of
Myny&#273; y Cnwc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2638src" href="#xd26e2638"
name="xd26e2638src">1</a> in the parish of &#7930;angwyfan, on the
south-western coast of Anglesey. The foot of Myny&#273; y Cnwc is
washed by the sea, and the mouth of the cave is closed by its waters at
high tide, but the cave, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458"
href="#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span>is spacious, has a vent-hole
in the side of the mountain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2668src" href=
"#xd26e2668" name="xd26e2668src">2</a>. So it is at any rate reported
in the <i>Brython</i> for 1859, p. 138, by a writer who explored the
place, though not to the end of the mile which it is said to measure in
length. He mentions a local tradition, that it contains various
treasures, and that it temporarily afforded Arthur shelter in the
course of his wars with the <i>Gwy&#273;elod</i> or Goidels. But he
describes also a cromlech on the top of Myny&#273; y Cnwc, around which
there was a circle of stones, while within the latter there lies
buried, it is believed, an iron chest full of ancient gold. Various
attempts are said to have been made by the more greedy of the
neighbouring inhabitants to dig it up, but they have always been
frightened away by portents. Here then the guardians of the treasure
are creatures of a supernatural kind, as in many other instances, and
especially that of Dinas Emrys to be mentioned presently.</p>
<p>Next comes the first of a group of cave legends involving treasure
entrusted to the keeping of armed warriors. It is taken from Elijah
Waring&rsquo;s <i>Recollections and Anecdotes of Edward Williams</i>,
Iolo Morgannwg (London, 1850), pp. 95&ndash;8, where it is headed
&lsquo;A popular Tale in Glamorgan, by Iolo Morgannwg&rsquo;; a version
of it in Welsh will be found in the <i>Brython</i> for 1858, p. 162,
but Waring&rsquo;s version is in several respects better, and I give it
in his words:&mdash;&lsquo;A Welshman walking over London Bridge, with
a neat hazel staff in his hand, was accosted by an Englishman, who
asked him whence he came. &ldquo;I am from my own country,&rdquo;
answered the Welshman, in a churlish tone. &ldquo;Do not take it amiss,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>my friend,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;if
you will only answer my questions, and take my advice, it will be of
greater benefit to you than you imagine. That stick in your hand grew
on a spot under which are hid vast treasures of gold and silver; and if
you remember the place, and can conduct me to it, I will put you in
possession of those treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Welshman soon understood that the stranger was what he
called a cunning man, or conjurer, and for some time hesitated, not
willing to go with him among devils, from whom this magician must have
derived his knowledge; but he was at length persuaded to accompany him
into Wales; and going to Craig-y-Dinas [Rock of the Fortress], the
Welshman pointed out the spot whence he had cut the stick. It was from
the stock or root of a large old hazel: this they dug up, and under it
found a broad flat stone. This was found to close up the entrance into
a very large cavern, down into which they both went. In the middle of
the passage hung a bell, and the conjurer earnestly cautioned the
Welshman not to touch it. They reached the lower part of the cave,
which was very wide, and there saw many thousands of warriors lying
down fast asleep in a large circle, their heads outwards, every one
clad in bright armour, with their swords, shields, and other weapons
lying by them, ready to be laid hold on in an instant, whenever the
bell should ring and awake them. All the arms were so highly polished
and bright, that they illumined the cavern, as with the light of ten
thousand flames of fire. They saw amongst the warriors one greatly
distinguished from the rest by his arms, shield, battle-axe, and a
crown of gold set with the most precious stones, lying by his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the midst of this circle of warriors they saw two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>very large heaps, one of gold, the other of
silver. The magician told the Welshman that he might take as much as he
could carry away of either the one or the other, but that he was not to
take from both the heaps. The Welshman loaded himself with gold: the
conjurer took none, saying that he did not want it, that gold was of no
use but to those who wanted knowledge, and that his contempt of gold
had enabled him to acquire that superior knowledge and wisdom which he
possessed. In their way out he cautioned the Welshman again not to
touch the bell, but if unfortunately he should do so, it might be of
the most fatal consequence to him, as one or more of the warriors would
awake, lift up his head, and ask <i>if it was day</i>. &ldquo;Should
this happen,&rdquo; said the cunning man, &ldquo;you must, without
hesitation, answer <i>No, sleep thou on</i>; on hearing which he will
again lay down his head and sleep.&rdquo; In their way up, however, the
Welshman, overloaded with gold, was not able to pass the bell without
touching it&mdash;it rang&mdash;one of the warriors raised up his head,
and asked, &ldquo;Is it day?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the
Welshman promptly, &ldquo;it is not, sleep thou on;&rdquo; so they got
out of the cave, laid down the stone over its entrance, and replaced
the hazel tree. The cunning man, before he parted from his companion,
advised him to be economical in the use of his treasure; observing that
he had, with prudence, enough for life: but that if by unforeseen
accidents he should be again reduced to poverty, he might repair to the
cave for more; repeating the caution, not to touch the bell if
possible, but if he should, to give the proper answer, <i>that it was
not day</i>, as promptly as possible. He also told him that the
distinguished person they had seen was <span class="sc">Arthur</span>,
and the others his warriors; and they lay there asleep with their arms
ready at hand, for the dawn of that day when the <i>Black Eagle</i> and
the <i>Golden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name=
"pb461">461</a>]</span>Eagle</i> should go to war, the loud clamour of
which would make the earth tremble so much, that the bell would ring
loudly, and the warriors awake, take up their arms, and destroy all the
enemies of the Cymry, who afterwards should repossess the Island of
Britain, re-establish their own king and government at Caer&#7931;eon,
and be governed with justice, and blessed with peace so long as the
world endures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The time came when the Welshman&rsquo;s treasure was all
spent: he went to the cave, and as before overloaded himself. In his
way out he touched the bell: it rang: a warrior lifted up his head,
asking if it was day, but the Welshman, who had covetously overloaded
himself, being quite out of breath with labouring under his burden, and
withal struck with terror, was not able to give the necessary answer;
whereupon some of the warriors got up, took the gold away from him, and
beat him dreadfully. They afterwards threw him out, and drew the stone
after them over the mouth of the cave. The Welshman never recovered the
effects of that beating, but remained almost a cripple as long as he
lived, and very poor. He often returned with some of his friends to
Craig-y-Dinas; but they could never afterwards find the spot, though
they dug over, seemingly, every inch of the hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This story of Iolo&rsquo;s closes with a moral, which I omit in
order to make room for what he says in a note to the effect, that there
are two hills in Glamorganshire called Craig-y-Dinas&mdash;nowadays the
more usual pronunciation in South Wales is Craig y &#272;inas&mdash;one
in the parish of &#7930;antrissant and the other in Ystrad Dyfodwg.
There was also a hill so called, Iolo says, in the Vale of Towy, not
far from Carmarthen. He adds that in Glamorgan the tale is related of
the Carmarthenshire hill, while in Carmarthenshire the hill is said to
be in Glamorgan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462"
name="pb462">462</a>]</span>According to Iolo&rsquo;s son, Taliesin
Williams<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2721src" href="#xd26e2721" name=
"xd26e2721src">3</a> or Taliesin ab Iolo, the Craig y &#272;inas with
which the Cave of Arthur (or Owen Lawgoch) is associated is the one on
the borders of Glamorgan and Brecknockshire. That is also the opinion
of my friend Mr. Reynolds, who describes this <i>craig</i> and
<i>dinas</i> as a very bold rocky eminence at the top of the Neath
Valley, near Pont Ne&#273; Fechan. He adds that in this tale as related
to his mother &lsquo;in her very young days&rsquo; by a very old woman,
known as Mari Shencin y Clochy&#273; &lsquo;Jenkin the Sexton&rsquo;s
Mary,&rsquo; the place of Arthur was taken by Owen Lawgoch, &lsquo;Owen
of the Red Hand,&rsquo; of whom more anon.</p>
<p>The next Arthurian story is not strictly in point, for it makes no
allusion to treasure; but as it is otherwise so similar to Iolo&rsquo;s
tale I cannot well avoid introducing it here. It is included in the
composite story of <i lang="cy">Bwca &rsquo;r Trwyn</i>, &lsquo;the
Bogie of the Nose,&rsquo; written out for me in Gwentian Welsh by Mr.
Craigfryn Hughes. The cave portion relates how a Monmouthshire farmer,
whose house was grievously troubled by the bogie, set out one morning
to call on a wizard who lived near Caerleon, and how he on his way came
up with a very strange and odd man who wore a three-cornered hat. They
fell into conversation, and the strange man asked the farmer if he
should like to see something of a wonder. He answered he would.
&lsquo;Come with me then,&rsquo; said the wearer of the cocked hat,
&lsquo;and you shall see what nobody else alive to-day has seen.&rsquo;
When they had reached the middle of a wood this spiritual guide sprang
from horseback and kicked a big stone near the road. It instantly moved
aside to disclose the mouth of a large cave; and now said he to the
farmer, &lsquo;Dismount and bring your horse in here: tie him up
alongside of mine, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463</a>]</span>and follow me so that you may see something
which the eyes of man have not beheld for centuries.&rsquo; The farmer,
having done as he was ordered, followed his guide for a long distance:
they came at length to the top of a flight of stairs, where two huge
bells were hanging. &lsquo;Now mind,&rsquo; said the warning voice of
the strange guide, &lsquo;not to touch either of those bells.&rsquo; At
the bottom of the stairs there was a vast chamber with hundreds of men
lying at full length on the floor, each with his head reposing on the
stock of his gun. &lsquo;Have you any notion who these men are?&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the farmer, &lsquo;I have not, nor have I any
idea what they want in such a place as this.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said the guide, &lsquo;these are Arthur&rsquo;s thousand soldiers
reposing and sleeping till the Kymry have need of them. Now let us get
out as fast as our feet can carry us.&rsquo; When they reached the top
of the stairs, the farmer somehow struck his elbow against one of the
bells so that it rang, and in the twinkling of an eye all the sleeping
host rose to their feet shouting together, &lsquo;Are the Kymry in
straits?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not yet: sleep you on,&rsquo; replied the wearer
of the cocked hat, whereupon they all dropped down on their guns to
resume their slumbers at once. &lsquo;These are the valiant men,&rsquo;
he went on to say, &lsquo;who are to turn the scale in favour of the
Kymry when the time comes for them to cast the Saxon yoke off their
necks and to recover possession of their country.&rsquo; When the two
had returned to their horses at the mouth of the cave, his guide said
to the farmer, &lsquo;Now go in peace, and let me warn you on the pain
of death not to utter a syllable about what you have seen for the space
of a year and a day: if you do, woe awaits you.&rsquo; After he had
moved the stone back to its place the farmer lost sight of him. When
the year had lapsed the farmer happened to pass again that way, but,
though he made a long and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href=
"#pb464" name="pb464">464</a>]</span>careful search, he failed
completely to find the stone at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>To return to Iolo&rsquo;s yarn, one may say that there are traces of
his story as at one time current in Merionethshire, but with the
variation that the Welshman met the wizard not on London Bridge but at
a fair at Bala, and that the cave was somewhere in Merioneth: the hero
was Arthur, and the cave was known as Ogof Arthur. Whether any such
cave is still known I cannot tell; but a third and interestingly told
version is given in the <i>Brython</i> for 1858, p. 179, by the late
Gwyniony&#273;, who gives the story as the popular belief in his native
parish of Troed yr Aur, halfway between Newcastle Emlyn and Aber Porth,
in South Cardiganshire. In this last version the hero is not Arthur,
but the later man as follows:&mdash;Not the least of the wonders of
imagination wont to exercise the minds of the old people was the story
of Owen Lawgoch. One sometimes hears sung in our fairs the
words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Yr Owain hwn yw Harri &rsquo;r Nawfed</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Sy&#273; yn trigo &rsquo;ngwlad estronied,
&amp;c.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">This Owen is Henry the Ninth,</p>
<p class="line">Who tarries in a foreign land, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But this Owen Lawgoch, the national deliverer of our
ancient race of Brythons, did not, according to the Troed yr Aur
people, tarry in a foreign land, but somewhere in Wales, not far from
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke. They used to say that one Dafy&#273; Meirig of
Bettws Bledrws, having quarrelled with his father, left for
&#7930;oegr<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2762src" href="#xd26e2762" name=
"xd26e2762src">4</a>, &lsquo;England.&rsquo; When he had got a
considerable distance from home, he struck a bargain with a cattle
dealer to drive a herd of his beasts to London. Somewhere at the corner
of a vast moor Dafy&#273; cut a very remarkable hazel stick; for a good
staff is as essential to the vocation of a good drover as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>teeth are to a dog. So while his comrades had
had their sticks broken before reaching London, Dafy&#273;&rsquo;s
remained as it was, and whilst they were conversing together on London
Bridge a stranger accosted Dafy&#273;, wishing to know where he had
obtained that wonderful stick. He replied that it was in Wales he had
had it, and on the stranger&rsquo;s assuring him that there were
wondrous things beneath the tree on which it had grown, they both set
out for Wales. When they reached the spot and dug a little they found
that there was a great hollow place beneath. As night was spreading out
her sable mantle, and as they were getting deeper, what should they
find but stairs easy to step and great lamps illumining the vast
chamber! They descended slowly, with mixed emotions of dread and
invincible desire to see the place. When they reached the bottom of the
stairs, they found themselves near a large table, at one end of which
they beheld sitting a tall man of about seven foot. He occupied an
old-fashioned chair and rested his head on his left hand, while the
other hand, all red, lay on the table and grasped a great sword. He was
withal enjoying a wondrously serene sleep; and at his feet on the floor
lay a big dog. After casting a glance at them, the wizard said to
Dafy&#273;: &lsquo;This is Owen Lawgoch, who is to sleep on till a
special time, when he will wake and reign over the Brythons. That
weapon in his hand is one of the swords of the ancient kings of
Prydain. No battle was ever lost in which that sword was used.&rsquo;
Then they moved slowly on, gazing at the wonders of that subterranean
chamber; and they beheld everywhere the arms of ages long past, and on
the table thousands of gold pieces bearing the images of the different
kings of Prydain. They got to understand that it was permitted them to
take a handful of each, but not to put any in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>their purses. They both visited the cave several
times, but at last Dafy&#273; put in his purse a little of the gold
bearing the image of one of the bravest of Owen&rsquo;s ancestors. But
after coming out again they were never able any more to find
Owen&rsquo;s subterranean palace.</p>
<p>Those are, says Gwyniony&#273;, the ideas cherished by the old
people of Troed yr Aur in Keredigion, and the editor adds a note that
the same sort of story is current among the peasantry of Cumberland,
and perhaps of other parts of Britain. This remark will at once recall
to the reader&rsquo;s mind the well-known verses<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2771src" href="#xd26e2771" name="xd26e2771src">5</a> of the
Scottish poet, Leyden, as to Arthur asleep in a cave in the Eildon
Hills in the neighbourhood of Melrose Abbey. But he will naturally ask
why London Bridge is introduced into this and Iolo&rsquo;s story, and
in answer I have to say, firstly, that London Bridge formerly loomed
very large in the popular imagination as one of the chief wonders of
London, itself the most wonderful city in the world. Such at any rate
was the notion cherished as to London and London Bridge by the country
people of Wales, even within my own memory. Secondly, the fashion of
selecting London Bridge as the opening scene of a treasure legend had
been set, perhaps, by a widely spread English story to the following
effect:&mdash;A certain pedlar of Swaffham in Norfolk had a dream, that
if he went and stood on London Bridge he would have very joyful news;
as the dream was doubled and trebled he decided to go. So he stood on
the bridge two or three days, when at last a shopkeeper, observing that
he loitered there so long, neither offering anything for sale nor
asking for alms, inquired of him as to his business. The pedlar told
him his errand, and was heartily laughed at by the shopkeeper, who said
that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>had dreamt that night that he was at a place
called Swaffham in Norfolk, and that if he only dug under a great oak
tree in an orchard behind a pedlar&rsquo;s house there, he would find a
vast treasure; but the place was utterly unknown to him, and he was not
such a fool as to follow a silly dream. No, he was wiser than that; so
he advised the pedlar to go home to mind his business. The pedlar very
quietly took in the words as to the dream, and hastened home to
Swaffham, where he found the treasure in his own orchard. The rest of
the story need not be related here, as it is quite different from the
Welsh ones, which the reader has just had brought under his
notice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2785src" href="#xd26e2785" name=
"xd26e2785src">6</a>.</p>
<p>To return to Owen Lawgoch, for we have by no means done with him: on
the farm of Cil yr Ychen there stands a remarkable limestone hill
called <i lang="cy">y &#272;inas</i>, &lsquo;the Fortress,&rsquo;
hardly a mile to the north of the village of &#7930;andyb&iuml;e, in
Carmarthenshire. This <i lang="cy">dinas</i> and the lime-kilns that
are gradually consuming it are to be seen on the right from the railway
as you go from &#7930;andeilo to &#7930;andyb&iuml;e. It is a steep
high rock which forms a very good natural fortification, and in the
level area on the top is the mouth of a very long cavern, known as
<i lang="cy">Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas</i>, &lsquo;the Dinas Cave.&rsquo;
The entrance into it is small and low, but it gradually widens out,
becoming in one place lofty and roomy with several smaller branch caves
leading out of it; and it is believed that some of them connect
Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas with smaller caves at Pant y &#7930;yn,
&lsquo;the Lake Hollow,&rsquo; where, as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>name
indicates, there is a small lake a little higher up: both Ogo&rsquo;r
&#272;inas and Pant y &#7930;yn are within a mile of the village of
&#7930;andyb&iuml;e<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2807src" href=
"#xd26e2807" name="xd26e2807src">7</a>. Now I am informed, in a letter
written in 1893 by one native, that the local legend about Ogo&rsquo;r
&#272;inas is that Owen Lawgoch and his men are lying asleep in it,
while another native, Mr. Fisher, writing in the same year, but on the
authority of somewhat later hearsay, expresses himself as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I remember hearing two traditions respecting
Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas: (1) that King Arthur and his warriors lie
sleeping in it with their right hands clasping the hilts of their drawn
swords ready to encounter anyone who may venture to disturb their
repose&mdash;is there not a <i lang="cy">dinas</i> somewhere in
Carnarvonshire with a similar legend? (2) That Owen Lawgoch lived in it
some time or other: that is all that I remember having heard about him
in connection with this <i lang="cy">ogof</i>.&rsquo; Mr. Fisher
proceeds, moreover, to state that it is said of an <i lang=
"cy">ogof</i> at Pant y &#7930;yn, that Owen Lawgoch and his men on a
certain occasion took refuge in it, where they were shut up and starved
to death. He adds that, however this may be, it is a fact that in the
year 1813 ten or more human skeletons of unusual stature were
discovered in an <i lang="cy">ogof</i> there<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2829src" href="#xd26e2829" name="xd26e2829src">8</a>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span></p>
<p>To this I may append a reference to the <i>Geninen</i> for 1896, p.
84, where Mr. &#7930;eufer Thomas, who is also a native of the
district, alludes to the local belief that Owen Lawgoch and his men are
asleep, as already mentioned, in the cave of Pant y &#7930;yn, and that
they are to go on sleeping there till a trumpet blast and the clash of
arms on Rhiw Goch rouse them to sally forth to combat the Saxons and to
conquer, as set forth by Howells: see p. 381 above. It is needless to
say that there is no reason, as will be seen presently, to suppose Owen
Lawgoch to have ever been near any of the caves to which allusion has
here been made; but that does not appreciably detract from the
fascination of the legend which has gathered round his personality; and
in passing I may be allowed to express my surprise that in such stories
as these the earlier Owen has not been eclipsed by Owen Glyndwr: there
must be some historical reason why that has not taken place. Can it be
that a habit of caution made Welshmen speak of Owen Lawgoch when the
other Owen was really meant?</p>
<p>The passage I have cited from Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s letter raises the
question of a <i lang="cy">dinas</i> in Carnarvonshire, which that of
his native parish recalled to his mind; and this is to be considered
next. Doubtless he meant <i lang="cy">Dinas Emrys</i> formerly called
<i lang="cy">Din Emreis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2856src" href=
"#xd26e2856" name="xd26e2856src">9</a>, &lsquo;the Fortress of
Ambrosius,&rsquo; situated near Be&#273;gelert, and known in the
neighbourhood simply as <i lang="cy">y Dinas</i>, &lsquo;the
Fort.&rsquo; It is celebrated in the Vortigern legend as the place
where the dragons had been hidden, that frustrated the building
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>of that king&rsquo;s castle; and the spot is
described in Lewis&rsquo; <i>Topographical Dictionary of Wales</i>, in
the article on <i>Bethgelart</i> (<i>Be&#273;-Celert</i>), as an
isolated rocky eminence with an extensive top area, which is defended
by walls of loose stones, and accessible only on one side. He adds that
the entrance appears to have been guarded by two towers, and that
within the enclosed area are the foundations of circular buildings of
loose stones forming walls of about five feet in thickness. Concerning
that Dinas we read in the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 329, a legend to
the following effect:&mdash;Now after the departure of Vortigern,
Myr&#273;in, or Merlin as he is called in English, remained himself in
the Dinas for a long time, until, in fact, he went away with Emrys
Ben-aur, &lsquo;Ambrosius the Gold-headed&rsquo;&mdash;evidently
Aurelius Ambrosius is meant. When he was about to set out with the
latter, he put all his treasure and wealth into a <i lang="cy">crochan
aur</i>, &lsquo;a gold cauldron,&rsquo; and hid it in a cave in the
Dinas, and on the mouth of the cave he rolled a huge stone, which he
covered up with earth and sods, so that it was impossible for any one
to find it. He intended this wealth to be the property of some special
person in a future generation, and it is said that the heir to it is to
be a youth with yellow hair and blue eyes. When that one comes near to
the Dinas a bell will ring to invite him to the cave, which will open
of itself as soon as his foot touches it. Now the fact that some such
legend was once currently believed about Be&#273;gelert and Nanhwynain
is proved by the curious stories as to various attempts made to find
the treasure, and the thunderstorms and portents which used to vanquish
the local greed for gold. For several instances in point see the
<i>Brython</i>, pp. 329&ndash;30; and for others, showing how hidden
treasure is carefully reserved for the right sort of heir, see p. 148
above. To prove how widely this idea prevailed in Carnarvonshire,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>I may add a short story which Mrs.
Williams-Ellis of Glasfryn got from the engineer who told her of the
sacred eel of &#7930;angybi (p. 366):&mdash;There was on Pentyrch, the
hill above &#7930;angybi, he said, a large stone so heavy and fixed so
fast in the ground that no horses, no men could move it: it had often
been tried. One day, however, a little girl happened to be playing by
the stone, and at the touch of her little hand the stone moved. A hoard
of coins was found under it, and that at a time when the little
girl&rsquo;s parents happened to be in dire need of it. Search had long
been made by undeserving men for treasure supposed to be hidden at that
spot; but it was always unsuccessful until the right person touched the
stone to move. The failure of the wrong person to secure the treasure,
even when discovered, is illustrated by a story given by Mr. Derfel
Hughes in his <i>Antiquities of &#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>, pp. 35&ndash;6, to the effect that a servant
man, somewhere up among the mountains near Ogwen Lake, chanced to come
across the mouth of a cave with abundance of vessels of brass
(<i>pres</i>) of every shape and description within it. He went at once
and seized one of them, but, alas! it was too heavy for him to stir it.
So he resolved to go away and return early on the morrow with a friend
to help him; but before going he closed the mouth of the cave with
stones and sods so as to leave it safe. While thus engaged he
remembered having heard how others had like him found caves and failed
to refind them. He could procure nothing readily that would satisfy him
as a mark, so it occurred to him to dot his path with the chippings of
his stick, which he whittled all the way as he went back until he came
to a familiar track: the chips were to guide him back to the cave. So
when the morning came he and his friend set out, but when they reached
the point where the chips should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472"
href="#pb472" name="pb472">472</a>]</span>begin, not one was to be
seen: the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had picked up every one of them.
So that discovery of articles of brass&mdash;more probably
bronze&mdash;was in vain. But, says the writer, it is not fated to be
always in vain, for there is a tradition in the valley that it is a
Gwy&#273;el, &lsquo;Goidel, Irishman,&rsquo; who is to have these
treasures, and that it will happen in this wise:&mdash;A Gwy&#273;el
will come to the neighbourhood to be a shepherd, and one day when he
goes up the mountain to see to the sheep, just when it pleases the
fates a black sheep with a speckled head will run before him and make
straight for the cave: the sheep will go in, with the Gwy&#273;el in
pursuit trying to catch him. When the Gwy&#273;el enters he sees the
treasures, looks at them with surprise, and takes possession of them;
and thus, in some generation to come, the Gwy&#273;yl will have their
own restored to them. That is the tradition which Derfel Hughes found
in the vale of the Ogwen, and he draws from it the inference which it
seems to warrant, in words to the following effect:&mdash;Perhaps this
shows us that the Gwy&#273;yl had some time or other something to do
with these parts, and that we are not to regard as stories without
foundations all that is said of that nation; and the sayings of old
people to this day show that there is always some spite between our
nation and the Gwy&#273;yl. Thus, for instance, he goes on to say, if a
man proves changeable, he is said to have become a Gwy&#273;el
(<i lang="cy">Y mae wedi troi&rsquo;n Wy&#273;el</i>), or if one is
very shameless and cheeky he is called a Gwy&#273;el and told to hold
his tongue (<i lang="cy">Taw yr hen Wy&#273;el</i>); and a number of
such locutions used by our people proves, he thinks, the former
prevalence of much contention between the two sister-nations.
Expressions of the kind mentioned by Mr. Hughes are well known in all
parts of the Principality, and it is difficult to account for them
except on the supposition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href=
"#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>that Goidels and Brythons lived
for a long time face to face, so to say, with one another over large
areas in the west of our island.</p>
<p>The next story to be mentioned belongs to the same Snowdonian
neighbourhood, and brings us back to Arthur and his Men. For a writer
who has already been quoted from the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 331,
makes Arthur and his following set out from Dinas Emrys and cross Hafod
y Borth mountain for a place above the upper reach of Cwm&#7931;an,
called Tregalan, where they found their antagonists. From Tregalan the
latter were pushed up the <i lang="cy">bwlch</i> or pass, towards Cwm
Dyli; but when the vanguard of the army with Arthur leading had reached
the top of the pass, the enemy discharged a shower of arrows at them.
There Arthur fell, and his body was buried in the pass so that no enemy
might march that way so long as Arthur&rsquo;s dust rested there. That,
he says, is the story, and there to this day remains in the pass, he
asserts, the heap of stones called <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn&rsquo;: the pass is called <i lang=
"cy">Bwlch y Saethau</i>, &lsquo;the Pass of the Arrows.&rsquo; Then
Ogof &#7930;anciau Eryri is the subject of the following story given at
p. 371 of the same volume:&mdash;After Arthur&rsquo;s death on Bwlch y
Saethau, his men ascended to the ridge of the &#7930;iwe&#273; and
descended thence into a vast cave called <i lang="cy">Ogof
&#7930;anciau Eryri</i>, &lsquo;the young Men of Snowdonia&rsquo;s
Cave,&rsquo; which is in the precipitous cliff on the left-hand side
near the top of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw. This is in Cwm Dyli, and there
in that cave those warriors are said to be still, sleeping in their
armour and awaiting the second coming of Arthur to restore the crown of
Britain to the Kymry. For the saying is:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;ancia&rsquo; &rsquo;Ryri a&rsquo;u gwyn
gy&#7931; a&rsquo;i henni&#7931; hi.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Snowdonia&rsquo;s youths with their white hazels will
win it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As the local shepherds were one day long ago
collecting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>their sheep on the &#7930;iwe&#273;, one sheep
fell down to a shelf in this precipice, and when the Cwm Dyli shepherd
made his way to the spot he perceived that the ledge of rock on which
he stood led to the hidden cave of &#7930;anciau Eryri. There was light
within: he looked in and beheld a host of warriors without number all
asleep, resting on their arms and ready equipped for battle. Seeing
that they were all asleep, he felt a strong desire to explore the whole
place; but as he was squeezing in he struck his head against the bell
hanging in the entrance. It rang so that every corner of the immense
cave rang again, and all the warriors woke uttering a terrible shout,
which so frightened the shepherd that he never more enjoyed a
day&rsquo;s health; nor has anybody since dared as much as to approach
the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>Thus far the <i>Brython</i>, and I have only to remark that this
legend is somewhat remarkable for the fact of its representing the
Youths of Eryri sleeping away in their cave without Arthur among them.
In fact, that hero is described as buried not very far off beneath a
<i lang="cy">carne&#273;</i> or cairn on Bwlch y Saethau. As to the
exact situation of that cairn, I may say that my attention was drawn
some time ago to the following lines by Mr. William Owen, better known
as Glaslyn, a living bard bred and born in the district:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ger&#7931;aw Carne&#273; Arthur ar ysgwy&#273; y
Wy&#273;fa</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Y gorwe&#273; gwe&#273;i&#7931;ion y cawr enwog
Ricca.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Near Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn on the shoulder of
Snowdon</p>
<p class="line">Lie the remains of the famous giant Ricca.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">These words recall an older couplet in a poem by Rhys
Goch Eryri, who is said to have died in the year 1420. He was a native
of the parish of Be&#273;gelert, and his words in point run
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ar y drum oer dramawr,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yno gorwe&#273; Ricca Gawr.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">On the ridge cold and vast,</p>
<p class="line">There the Giant Ricca lies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span></p>
<p>From this it is clear that Rhys Goch meant that the cairn on the top
of Snowdon covered the remains of the giant whose name has been
variously written Ricca, Ritta, and Rhita. So I was impelled to
ascertain from Glaslyn whether I had correctly understood his lines,
and he has been good enough to help me out of some of my difficulties,
as I do not know Snowdon by heart, especially the Nanhwynain and
Be&#273;gelert side of the mountain:&mdash;The cairn on the summit of
Snowdon was the Giant&rsquo;s before it was demolished and made into a
sort of tower which existed before the hotel was made. Glaslyn has not
heard it called after Ricca&rsquo;s name, but he states that old people
used to call it <i lang="cy">Carne&#273; y Cawr</i>, &lsquo;the
Giant&rsquo;s Cairn.&rsquo; In 1850 <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn,&rsquo; was to be seen on the top of Bwlch
y Saethau, but he does not know whether it is still so, as he has not
been up there since the building of the hotel. Bwlch y Saethau is a
lofty shoulder of Snowdon extending in the direction of Nanhwynain, and
the distance from the top of Snowdon to it is not great; it would take
you half an hour or perhaps a little more to walk from the one <i lang=
"cy">carne&#273;</i> to the other. It is possible to trace
Arthur&rsquo;s march from Dinas Emrys up the slopes of Hafod y Borth,
over the shoulder of the Aran and Braich yr Oen to Tregalan&mdash;or
Cwm Tregalan, as it is now called&mdash;but from Tregalan he would have
to climb in a north-easterly direction in order to reach Bwlch y
Saethau, where he is related to have fallen and to have been interred
beneath a cairn. This may be regarded as an ordinary or commonplace
account of his death. But the scene suggests a far more romantic
picture; for down below was &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw with its sequestered
isle, connected then by means only of a primitive canoe with a shore
occupied by men engaged in working the ore of Eryri. Nay with the eyes
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>Malory we seem to watch Bedivere making, with
Excalibur in his hands, his three reluctant journeys to the lake ere he
yielded it to the arm emerging from the deep. We fancy we behold how
&lsquo;euyn fast by the banke houed a lytyl barge wyth many fayr ladyes
in hit,&rsquo; which was to carry the wounded Arthur away to the
accompaniment of mourning and loud lamentation; but the legend of the
Marchlyn bids us modify Malory&rsquo;s language as to the barge
containing many ladies all wearing black hoods, and take our last look
at the warrior departing rather in a coracle with three wondrously fair
women attending to his wounds<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3016src" href=
"#xd26e3016" name="xd26e3016src">10</a>.</p>
<p>Some further notes on Snowdon, together with a curious account of
the Cave of &#7930;anciau Eryri, have been kindly placed at my disposal
by Mr. Ellis Pierce (Elis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3024src" href=
"#xd26e3024" name="xd26e3024src">11</a> o&rsquo;r Nant) of
Dolwy&#273;elan:&mdash;In the uppermost part of the hollow called
Cwm&#7931;an is Tregalan, and in the middle of Cwm Tregalan is a green
hill, or rather an eminence which hardly forms a hill, but what is
commonly called a <i lang="cy">boncyn</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3089src" href="#xd26e3089" name="xd26e3089src">12</a> in
Carnarvonshire, and between that green <i lang="cy">boncyn</i> and the
<i lang="cy">Clogwyn Du</i>, &lsquo;Black Precipice,&rsquo; is a bog,
the depth of which no one has ever succeeded in ascertaining, and a
town&mdash;inferred perhaps from <i lang="cy">tre</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span>in
<i>Tregalan</i>&mdash;is fabled to have been swallowed up there.
Another of my informants speaks of several hillocks or <i>boncyns</i>
as forming one side of this little <i lang="cy">cwm</i>; but he has
heard from geologists, that these green mounds represent moraines
deposited there in the glacial period. From the bottom of the Clogwyn
Du it is about a mile to Bwlch y Saethau. Then as to the cave of
&#7930;anciau Eryri, which nobody can now find, the slope down to it
begins from the top of the &#7930;iwe&#273;, but ordinarily speaking
one could not descend to where it is supposed to have been without the
help of ropes, which seems incompatible with the story of the Cwm Dyli
shepherd following a sheep until he was at the mouth of the cave; not
to mention the difficulty which the descent would have offered to
Arthur&rsquo;s men when they entered it. Then Elis o&rsquo;r
Nant&rsquo;s story represents it shutting after them, and only opening
to the shepherd in consequence of his having trodden on a particular
sod or spot. He then slid down unintentionally and touched the bell
that was hanging there, so that it rang and instantly woke the sleeping
warriors. No sooner had that happened than those men of Arthur&rsquo;s
took up their guns&mdash;never mind the anachronism&mdash;and the
shepherd made his way out more dead than alive; and the frightened
fellow never recovered from the shock to the day of his death. When
these warriors take up their guns they fire away, we are told, without
mercy from where each man stands: they are not to advance a single step
till Arthur comes to call them back to the world.</p>
<p>To swell the irrelevancies under which this chapter labours already,
and to avoid severing cognate questions too rudely, I wish to add that
Elis o&rsquo;r Nant makes the name of the giant buried on the top of
Snowdon into Rhitta or Rhita instead of Ricca. That is also the form of
the name with which Mrs. Rhys was familiar throughout <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name="pb478">478</a>]</span>her
childhood on the &#7930;anberis side of the mountain. She often heard
of Rhita<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3131src" href="#xd26e3131" name=
"xd26e3131src">13</a> Gawr having been buried on the top of Snowdon,
and of other warriors on other parts of Snowdon such as Moel Gynghorion
and the Gist on that <i>moel</i>. But Elis o&rsquo;r Nant goes further,
and adds that from Rhita the mountain was called <i>Wy&#273;fa
Rhita</i>, more correctly <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa Rita</i>,
&lsquo;Rhita&rsquo;s Gwy&#273;fa.&rsquo; Fearing this might be merely
an inference, I have tried to cross-examine him so far as that is
possible by letter. He replies that his father was bred and born in the
little glen called Ewybrnant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3166src" href=
"#xd26e3166" name="xd26e3166src">14</a>, between Bettws y Coed and Pen
Machno, and that his grandfather also lived there, where he appears to
have owned land not far from the home of the celebrated Bishop Morgan.
Now Elis&rsquo; father often talked, he says, in his hearing of
&lsquo;Gwy&#273;fa Rhita.&rsquo; Wishing to have some more definite
evidence, I wrote again, and he informs me that his father was very
fond of talking about <i>his</i> father, Elis o&rsquo;r Nant&rsquo;s
grandfather, who appears to have been a character and a great supporter
of Sir Robert Williams, especially in a keenly contested political
election in 1796, when the latter was opposed by the then head of the
Penrhyn family. Sometimes the old man from Ewybrnant would set out in
his <i lang="cy">clocs</i>, &lsquo;clogs or wooden shoes,&rsquo; to
visit Sir Robert Williams, who lived at Plas y Nant, near
Be&#273;gelert. On starting he would say to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name=
"pb479">479</a>]</span>family, <i lang="cy">Mi a&rsquo;i hyibio troed
Gwy&#273;fa Rhita ag mi &#273;o&rsquo;n ol rwbrud cin nos</i>, or
sometimes <i lang="cy">foru</i>. That is, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go round
the foot of Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa</i> and come back
some time before night&rsquo;: sometimes he would say
&lsquo;to-morrow.&rsquo; Elis also states that his father used to
relate how Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa</i> was built, namely
by the simple process of each of his soldiers taking a stone to place
on Rhita&rsquo;s tomb. However the story as to Rhita Gawr being buried
on the top of Snowdon came into existence, there can be no doubt that
it was current in comparatively recent times, and that the Welsh name
of <i lang="cy">y Wy&#273;fa</i>, derived from it, refers to the
mountain as distinguished from the district in which it is situated. In
Welsh this latter is Eryri, the habitat, as it were, of the <i lang=
"cy">eryr</i>, &lsquo;eagle,&rsquo; a bird formerly at home there as
many local names go to prove, such as <i lang="cy">Carreg yr
Eryr</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3217src" href="#xd26e3217" name=
"xd26e3217src">15</a>, &lsquo;the Stone of the Eagle,&rsquo; mentioned
in the boundaries of the lands on Snowdon granted to the Abbey of
Aberconwy in &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s charter, where also Snowdon mountain
is called <i lang="cy">Wedua vawr</i>, &lsquo;the Great
Gwy&#273;fa.&rsquo; Now, as already suggested, the word <i lang=
"cy">gwy&#273;fa</i> takes us back to Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang=
"cy">Carne&#273;</i> or Cairn, as it signified a monument, a tomb or
barrow: Dr. Davies gives it in his Welsh-Latin Dictionary as <i lang=
"la">Locus Sepultur&aelig;, Mausoleum</i>. This meaning of the word may
be illustrated by a reference in passing to the mention in <i lang=
"cy">Brut y Tywysogion</i> of the burial of Madog ab Maredy&#273;. For
under the year 1159 we are told that he was interred at Meifod, as it
was there his tomb or the vault of his family, the one intended also
for him (<i lang="cy">y &#7933;ydua</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3258src" href="#xd26e3258" name="xd26e3258src">16</a>), happened
to be. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span></p>
<p>Against the evidence just given, that tradition places Rhita&rsquo;s
grave on the top of Snowdon, a passing mention by Derfel Hughes (p. 52)
is of no avail, though to the effect that it is on the top of the
neighbouring mountain called <i lang="cy">Carne&#273; Lywelyn</i>,
&lsquo;&#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s Cairn,&rsquo; that Rhita&rsquo;s Cairn was
raised. He deserves more attention, however, when he places <i lang=
"cy">Carne&#273; Drystan</i>, &lsquo;Tristan or Tristram&rsquo;s
Cairn,&rsquo; on a spur of that mountain, to wit, towards the east
above Ffynnon y &#7930;yffaint<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3276src"
href="#xd26e3276" name="xd26e3276src">17</a>. For it is worthy of note
that the name of Drystan, associated with Arthur in the later romances,
should figure with that of Arthur in the topography of the same Snowdon
district.</p>
<p>Before leaving Snowdon I may mention a cave near a small stream not
far from &#7930;yn Gwynain, about a mile and a half above Dinas Emrys.
In the &#7930;wyd letter (printed in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for
1859, pp. 142, 209), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481"
name="pb481">481</a>]</span>on which I have already drawn, it is called
<i lang="cy">Ogo&rsquo;r Gwr Blew</i>, &lsquo;the Hairy Man&rsquo;s
Cave&rsquo;; and the story relates how the Gwr Blew who lived in it was
fatally wounded by a woman who happened to be at home, alone, in one of
the nearest farm houses when the Gwr Blew came to plunder it. Its sole
interest here is that a later version<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3373src" href="#xd26e3373" name="xd26e3373src">18</a> identifies
the Hairy Man with Owen Lawgoch, after modifying the former&rsquo;s
designation <i lang="cy">y Gwr Blew</i>, which literally meant
&lsquo;the Hair Man,&rsquo; into <i lang="cy">y Gwr Blewog</i>,
&lsquo;the Hairy Man.&rsquo; This doubtful instance of the presence of
Owen Lawgoch in the folklore of North Wales seems to stand alone.</p>
<p>Some of these cave stories, it will have been seen, reveal to us a
hero who is expected to return to interfere again in the affairs of
this world, and it is needless to say that Wales is by no means alone
in the enjoyment of imaginary prospects of this kind. The same sort of
poetic expectation has not been unknown, for instance, in Ireland. In
the summer of 1894, I spent some sunny days in the neighbourhood of the
Boyne, and one morning I resolved to see the chief burial mounds
dotting the banks of that interesting river; but before leaving the
hotel at Drogheda, my attention was attracted by a book of railway
advertisement of the kind which forcibly impels one to ask two
questions: why will not the railway companies leave those people alone
who do not want to travel, and why will they make it so tedious for
those who do? But on turning the leaves of that booklet over I was
inclined to a suaver mood, as I came on a paragraph devoted to an
ancient stronghold called the Grianan of Aileach, or Greenan-Ely, in
the highlands of Donegal. Here I read that a thousand armed men sit
resting there on their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href=
"#pb482" name="pb482">482</a>]</span>swords, and bound by magic sleep
till they are to be called forth to take their part in the struggle for
the restoration of Erin&rsquo;s freedom. At intervals they awake, it is
said, and looking up from their trance they ask in tones which solemnly
resound through the many chambers of the Grianan: &lsquo;Is the time
come?&rsquo; A loud voice, that of the spiritual caretaker, is heard to
reply: &lsquo;The time is not yet.&rsquo; They resume their former
posture and sink into their sleep again. That is the substance of the
words I read, and they called to my mind the legend of such heroes of
the past as Barbarossa, with his sleep interrupted only by his change
of posture once in seven years; of Dom Sebastian, for centuries
expected from Moslem lands to restore the glories of Portugal; of the
Cid Rodrigo, expected back to do likewise with the kingdom of Castile;
and last, but not least, of the O&rsquo;Donoghue who sleeps beneath the
Lakes of Killarney, ready to emerge to right the wrongs of Erin. With
my head full of these and the like dreams of folklore, I was taken over
the scene of the Battle of the Boyne; and the car-driver, having vainly
tried to interest me in it, gave me up in despair as an uncultured
savage who felt no interest in the history of Ireland. However he
somewhat changed his mind when, on reaching the first ancient burial
mound, he saw me disappear underground, fearless of the Fomhoraigh; and
he began to wonder whether I should ever return to pay him his fare.
This in fact was the sheet anchor of all my hopes; for I thought that
in case I remained fast in a narrow passage, or lost my way in the
chambers of the prehistoric dead, the jarvey must fetch me out again.
So by the time I had visited three of these ancient places, Dowth,
Knowth, and New Grange, I had risen considerably in his opinion; and he
bethought him of stories older than the Battle of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name="pb483">483</a>]</span>the
Boyne. So he told me on the way back several bits of something less
drearily historical. Among other things, he pointed in the direction of
a place called Ardee in the county of Louth, where, he said, there is
Garry Geerlaug&rsquo;s enchanted fort full of warriors in magic sleep,
with Garry Geerlaug himself in their midst. Once on a time a herdsman
is said to have strayed into their hall, he said, and to have found the
sleepers each with his sword and his spear ready to hand. But as the
intruder could not keep his hands off the metal wealth of the place,
the owners of the spears began to rouse themselves, and the intruder
had to flee for his life. But there that armed host is awaiting the
eventful call to arms, when they are to sally forth to restore
prosperity and glory to Ireland. That was his story, and I became all
attention as soon as I heard of Ardee, which is in Irish <i lang=
"ga">&Aacute;th Fhir-dheadh</i>, or the Ford of Fer-deadh, so called
from Fer-deadh, who fought a protracted duel with C&uacute;chulainn in
that ford, where at the end, according to a well-known Irish story, he
fell by C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s hand. I was still more exercised by
the name of Garry Geerlaug, as I recognized in Garry an Anglo-Irish
pronunciation of the Norse name Godhfreydhr, later Godhroedh, sometimes
rendered Godfrey and sometimes Godred, while in Man and in Scotland it
has become Gorry, which may be heard also in Ireland. I thought,
further, that I recognized the latter part of Garry Geerlaug&rsquo;s
designation as the Norse female name Geirlaug. There was no complete
lack of Garries in that part of Ireland in the tenth and eleventh
centuries; but I have not yet found any historian to identify for me
the warrior named or nicknamed Garry Geerlaug, who is to return
blinking to this world of ours when his nap is over. Leaving Ireland, I
was told the other day of a place called Tom na Hurich, near Inverness,
where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484</a>]</span>Finn and his following are resting, each on his
left elbow, enjoying a broken sleep while waiting for the note to be
sounded, which is to call them forth. What they are then to do I have
not been told: it may be that they will proceed at once to solve the
Crofter Question, for there will doubtless be one.</p>
<p>It appears, to come back to Wales, that King Cadwaladr, who waged an
unsuccessful war with the Angles of Northumbria in the seventh century,
was long after his death expected to return to restore the Brythons to
power. At any rate so one is led in some sort of a hazy fashion to
believe in reading several of the poems in the manuscript known as the
<i>Book of Taliessin</i>. One finds, however, no trace of Cadwaladr in
our cave legends: the heroes of them are Arthur and Owen Lawgoch. Now
concerning Arthur one need at this point hardly speak, except to say
that the Welsh belief in the eventual return of Arthur was at one time
a powerful motive affecting the behaviour of the people of Wales, as
was felt, for instance, by English statesmen in the reign of Henry II.
But by our time the expected return of Arthur&mdash;<i lang="la">rexque
futurus</i>&mdash;has dissipated itself into a commonplace of folklore
fitted only to point an allegory, as when Elvet Lewis, one of the
sweetest of living Welsh poets, sings in a poem entitled <i lang=
"cy">Arthur gyda ni</i>, &lsquo;Arthur with us&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Not so with regard to the hopes associated with the
name of Owen Lawgoch; for we have it on Gwyniony&#273;&rsquo;s
testimony, p. 464, that our old <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> or ballad men
used to sing about him at Welsh fairs: it is not in the least
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=
"pb485">485</a>]</span>improbable that they still do so here and there,
unless the horrors of the ghastly murder last reported in the
newspapers have been found to pay better. At any rate Mr. Fisher (p.
379) has known old people in his native district in the &#7930;ychwr
Valley who could repeat stanzas or couplets from the ballads in
question. He traces these scraps to a booklet entitled
<i>Merlin&rsquo;s Prophecy<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3460src" href=
"#xd26e3460" name="xd26e3460src">19</a>, together with a brief history
of his life, taken from the Book of Prognostication</i>. This little
book bears no date, but appears to have been published in the early
part of the nineteenth century. It is partly in prose, dealing briefly
with the history of Merlin the Wild or Silvaticus, and the rest
consists of two poems. The first of these poems is entitled <i lang=
"cy">Dechreu Darogan Myr&#273;in</i>, &lsquo;the Beginning of
Merlin&rsquo;s Prognostication,&rsquo; and is made up of forty-nine
verses, several of which speak of Owen as king conquering all his foes
and driving out the Saxons: then in the forty-seventh stanza comes the
couplet which says, that this Owen is Henry the Ninth, who is tarrying
in a foreign land. The other poem is of a more general character, and
is entitled the Second Song of Merlin&rsquo;s Prognostication,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>and consists of twenty-six stanzas of four lines
each like the previous one; but the third stanza describes
Arthur&rsquo;s bell at Caer&#7931;eon, &lsquo;Caerleon,&rsquo; ringing
with great vigour to herald the coming of Owen; and the seventh stanza
begins with the following couplet:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ceir gweled Owen Law-goch yn d&rsquo;od i Frydain
Fawr,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ceir gweled newyn ceiniog yn nhref

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Owen Lawgoch one shall to Britain coming see,</p>
<p class="line">And dearth of pennies find at Chester on the Dee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">It closes with the date in verse at the end, to wit,
1668, which takes us back to very troublous times: 1668 was the year of
the Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and Holland against Louis XIV;
and it was not long after the Plague had raged, and London had had its
Great Fire. So it is a matter of no great surprise if some people in
Wales had a notion that the power of England was fast nearing its end,
and that the <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> thought it opportune to
refurbish and adapt some of Merlin&rsquo;s prophecies as likely to be
acceptable to the peasantry of South Wales. At all events we have no
reason to suppose that the two poems which have here been described
from Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s data represented either the gentry of Wales,
whose ordinary speech was probably for the most part English, or the
bardic fraternity, who would have looked with contempt at the language
and style of the Prognostication. For, apart from careless printing,
this kind of literature can lay no claim to merit in point of diction
or of metre. Such productions represent probably the <i lang=
"cy">baledwyr</i> and the simple country people, such as still listen
in rapt attention to them doing at Welsh fairs and markets what they
are pleased to regard as singing. All this fits in well enough with the
folklore of the caves, such as the foregoing stories represent it. Here
I may add that I am informed by Mr. Craigfryn Hughes of a tradition
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>that Arthur and his men are biding their time
near Caerleon on the Usk, to wit, in a cave resembling generally those
described in the foregoing legends. He also mentions a tradition as to
Owen Glyndwr&mdash;so he calls him, though it is unmistakably the Owen
of the <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> who have been referred to by Mr.
Fisher&mdash;that he and his men are similarly slumbering in a cave in
Craig Gwrtheyrn, in Carmarthenshire. That is a spot in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;andyssil, consisting of an elevated field
terminating on one side in a sharp declivity, with the foot of the rock
laved by the stream of the Teifi. <i lang="cy">Craig Gwrtheyrn</i>
means Vortigern&rsquo;s Rock, and it is one of the sites with which
legend associates the name of that disreputable old king. I am not
aware that it shows any traces of ancient works, but it looks at a
distance an ideal site for an old fortification. An earlier prophecy
about Owen Lawgoch than any of these occurs, as kindly pointed out to
me by Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, in the Peniarth MS. 94 (= Hengwrt MS. 412,
p. 23), and points back possibly to the last quarter of the fourteenth
century. See also one quoted by him, from the Mostyn MS. 133, in his
<i>Report on MSS. in the Welsh Language</i>, i. 106. Probably many more
such prophecies might be discovered if anybody undertook to make a
systematic search for them.</p>
<p>But who was Owen Lawgoch, if there ever was such a man? Such a man
there was undoubtedly; for we read in one of the documents printed in
the miscellaneous volume commonly known as the <i>Record of
Carnarvon</i>, that at a court held at Conway in the forty-fourth year
of Edward III a certain Gruffy&#273; Says was adjudged to forfeit all
the lands which he held in Anglesey to the Prince of Wales&mdash;who
was at that time no other than Edward the Black Prince&mdash;for the
reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>that the said Gruffy&#273; had been an adherent
of Owen: <i lang="la">adherens fuisset Owino Lawegogh</i> (or <i lang=
"cy">Lawgogh</i>) <i lang="la">inimico et proditori predicti domini
Principis et de consilio predicti Owyni ad mouendam guerram in Wallia
contra predictum dominum Principem</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3528src" href="#xd26e3528" name="xd26e3528src">20</a>. How long
previously it had been attempted to begin a war on behalf of this Owen
Lawgoch one cannot say, but it so happens that at this time there was a
captain called <i>Yeuwains</i>, <i>Yewains</i>, or <i>Yvain de
Gales</i> or <i>Galles</i>, &lsquo;Owen of Wales,&rsquo; fighting on
the French side against the English in Edward&rsquo;s Continental wars.
Froissart in his <i>Chronicles</i> has a great deal to say of him, for
he distinguished himself greatly on various critical occasions. From
the historian&rsquo;s narrative one finds that Owen had escaped when a
boy to the court of Philip VI of France, who received him with great
favour and had him educated with his own nephews. Froissart&rsquo;s
account of him is, that the king of England, Edward III, had slain his
father and given his lordship and principality to his own son as Prince
of Wales; and Froissart gives Owen&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name as
<i>Aymon</i>, which should mean <i>Edmond</i>, unless the name intended
may have been rather <i>Einion</i>. However that may have been, Owen
was engaged in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and when peace was made
he went to serve in Lombardy; but when war between England and France
broke out again in 1369, he returned to France. He sometimes fought on
sea and sometimes on land, but he was always entrusted by the French
king, who was now Charles V, with important commands<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3565src" href="#xd26e3565" name="xd26e3565src">21</a>. Thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span>in 1372 he was placed at the head of a flotilla
with 3,000 men, and ordered to operate against the English: he made a
descent on the Isle of Guernsey<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3572src"
href="#xd26e3572" name="xd26e3572src">22</a>, and while there besieging
the castle of Cornet, he was charged by the king of France to sail to
Spain to invite the king of Castile to send his fleet again to help in
the attack on La Rochelle. Whilst staying at Santander the earl of
Pembroke was brought thither, having been taken prisoner in the course
of the destruction of the English fleet before La Rochelle. Owen, on
seeing the earl of Pembroke, asks him with bitterness if he is come
there to do him homage for his land, of which he had taken possession
in Wales. He threatens to avenge himself on him as soon as he can, and
also on the earl of Hereford and Edward Spencer, for it was by the
fathers of these three men, he said, his own father had been betrayed
to death. Edward III died in 1377, and the Black Prince had died
shortly before. Owen survived them both, and was actively engaged in
the siege of Mortagne sur Mer in Poitou, when he was assassinated by
one Lamb, who had insinuated himself into his service and confidence,
partly by pretending to bring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490"
href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>him news about his native
land and telling him that all Wales was longing to have him back to be
the lord of his country&mdash;<i lang="fr">et lui fist acroire que
toute li terre de Gales le desiroient mout &agrave; ravoir &agrave;
seigneur</i>. So Owen fell in the year 1378, and was buried at the
church of Saint-L&eacute;ger<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3612src" href=
"#xd26e3612" name="xd26e3612src">23</a> while Lamb returned to the
English to receive his stipulated pay. When this happened Owen&rsquo;s
namesake, Owen Glyndwr, was nearly thirty years of age. The latter was
eventually to assert with varying fortune on several fields of battle
in this country the claims of his elder kinsman, who, by virtue of his
memory in France, would seem to have rendered it easy for the later
Owen to enter into friendly relations with the French court of his
day<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3637src" href="#xd26e3637" name=
"xd26e3637src">24</a>.</p>
<p>Now as to Yvain de Galles, the Rev. Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc) in
his <i>Hanes Cymru</i>, &lsquo;History of Wales,&rsquo; devotes a
couple of pages, 735&ndash;7, to Froissart&rsquo;s account of him, and
he points out that Angharad &#7930;wyd, in her edition of Sir John
Wynne&rsquo;s <i>History of the Gwydir Family</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3650src" href="#xd26e3650" name="xd26e3650src">25</a>, had found
Owen Lawgoch to have been Owen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491"
href="#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span>ab Thomas ab Rhodri, brother
to &#7930;ewelyn, the last native prince of Wales. One of the names,
however, among other things, forms a difficulty: why did Froissart call
Yvain&rsquo;s father Aymon? So it is clear that a more searching study
of Welsh pedigrees and other documents, including those at the Record
Office<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3663src" href="#xd26e3663" name=
"xd26e3663src">26</a>, has to be made before Owen can be satisfactorily
placed in point of succession. For that he was in the right line to
succeed the native princes of Wales is suggested both by the eagerness
with which all Wales was represented as looking to his return to be the
lord of the country, and by the opening words of Froissart in
describing what he had been robbed of by Edward III, as being both
lordship and principality&mdash;<i lang="fr">la signourie et
princet&eacute;</i>. Be that as it may, there is, it seems to me,
little doubt that Yvain de Galles was no other than the Owen Lawgoch,
whose adherent Gruffy&#273; Says was deprived of his land and property
in the latter part of Edward&rsquo;s reign. In the next place, there is
hardly room for doubt that the Owen Lawgoch here referred to was the
same man whom the <i>baledwyr</i> in their jumble of prophecies
intended to be Henry the Ninth, that is to say the Welsh successor to
the last Tudor king, Henry VIII, and that he was at the same time the
hero of the cave legends of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href=
"#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>divers parts of the Principality,
especially South Wales, as already indicated.</p>
<p>Now without being able to say why Owen and his analogues should
become the heroes of cave legends contemplating a second advent, it is
easy to point to circumstances which facilitated their doing so. It is
useless to try to discuss the question of Arthur&rsquo;s disappearance;
but take Garry Geerlaug, for instance, a roving Norseman, as we may
suppose from his name, who may have suddenly disappeared with his
followers, never more to be heard of in the east of Ireland. In the
absence of certain news of his death, it was all the easier to imagine
that he was dozing quietly away in an enchanted fortress. Then as to
King Cadwaladr, who was also, perhaps, to have returned to this world,
so little is known concerning his end that historians have no certainty
to this day when or where he died. So much the readier therefore would
the story gain currency that he was somewhere biding his time to come
back to retrieve his lost fortunes. Lastly, there is Owen Lawgoch, the
magic of whose name has only been dissipated in our own day: he died in
France in the course of a protracted war with the kings of England. It
is not likely, then, that the peasantry of Wales could have heard
anything definite about his fate. So here also the circumstances were
favourable to the cave legend and the dream that he was, whether at
home or abroad, only biding his time. Moreover, in all these cases the
hope-inspiring delusion gained currency among a discontented people,
probably, who felt the sore need of a deliverer to save them from
oppression or other grievous hardships of their destiny.</p>
<p>The question can no longer be prevented from presenting itself as to
the origin of this idea of a second advent of a hero of the past; but
in that form it is too <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href=
"#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span>large for discussion here, and it
would involve a review, for instance, of one of the cardinal beliefs of
the Latter-day Saints as to the coming of Christ to reign on earth, and
other doctrines supposed to be derived from the New Testament. On the
other hand, there is no logical necessity why the expected deliverer
should have been in the world before: witness the Jews, who are looking
forward not to the return but to the birth and first coming of their
Messiah. So the question here may be confined more or less strictly to
its cave-legend form; and though I cannot answer it, some advance in
the direction whence the answer should come may perhaps be made. In the
first place, one will have noticed that Arthur and Owen Lawgoch come
more or less in one another&rsquo;s way; and the presumption is that
Owen Lawgoch has been to a certain extent ousting Arthur, who may be
regarded as having the prior claim, not to mention that in the case of
the Gwr Blew cave, p. 481, Owen is made by an apparently recent version
of the story to evict from his lair a commonplace robber of no special
interest. In other words, the Owen Lawgoch legend is, so to say,
detected spreading itself<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3684src" href=
"#xd26e3684" name="xd26e3684src">27</a>. That is very possibly just
what had happened at a remoter period in the case of the Arthur legend
itself. In other words, Arthur has taken the place of some ancient
divinity, such as that dimly brought within our ken by Plutarch in the
words placed at the head of this chapter. He reproduces the report of a
certain Demetrius, sent by the emperor of Rome to reconnoitre and
inspect the coasts of Britain. It was to the effect that around
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name=
"pb494">494</a>]</span>Britain lay many uninhabited islands, some of
which are named after deities and some after heroes; and of the islands
inhabited, he visited the one nearest to the uninhabited ones. Of this
the dwellers were few, but the people of Britain treated them as
sacrosanct and inviolable in their persons. Among other things, they
related to him how terrible storms, diseases, and portents happened on
the occasion of any one of the mighty leaving this life. He
adds:&mdash;&lsquo;Moreover there is, they said, an island in which
Cronus is imprisoned, with Briareus keeping guard over him as he
sleeps; for, as they put it, sleep is the bond forged for Cronus. They
add that around him are many divinities, his henchmen and
attendants<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3698src" href="#xd26e3698" name=
"xd26e3698src">28</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What divinity, Celtic or pre-Celtic, this may have been who recalled
Cronus or Saturn to the mind of the Roman officer, it is impossible to
say. It is to be noticed that he sleeps and that his henchmen are with
him, but no allusion is made to treasure. No more is there, however, in
Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s version of the story of Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas,
which, according to him, says that Arthur and his warriors there lie
sleeping with their right hands clasping the hilts of their drawn
swords, ready to encounter any one who may venture to disturb their
repose. On the other hand, legends about cave treasure are probably
very ancient, and in some at least of our stories the safe keeping of
such treasure must be regarded as the original object of the presence
of the armed host.</p>
<p>The permission supposed to be allowed an intruder to take away a
reasonable quantity of the cave gold, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb495" href="#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span>I should look at in
the light of a sort of protest on the part of the story-teller against
the niggardliness of the cave powers. I cannot help suspecting in the
same way that the presence of a host of armed warriors to guard some
piles of gold and silver for unnumbered ages must have struck the fancy
of the story-tellers as disproportionate, and that this began long ago
to cause a modification in the form of the legends. That is to say, the
treasure sank into a mere accessory of the presence of the armed men,
who are not guarding any such thing so much as waiting for the destined
hour when they are to sally forth to make lost causes win. Originally
the armed warriors were in some instances presumably the henchmen of a
sleeping divinity, as in the story told to Demetrius; but perhaps
oftener they were the guardians of treasure, just as much as the
invisible agencies are, which bring on thunder and lightning and
portents when any one begins to dig at Dinas Emrys or other spots where
ancient treasure lies hidden. There is, it must be admitted, no
objection to regarding the attendants of a divinity as at the same time
the guardians of his treasure. In none, however, of these cave stories
probably may we suppose the principal figure to have originally been
that of the hero expected to return among men: he, when found in them,
is presumably to be regarded as a comparatively late interloper. But it
is, as already hinted, not to be understood that the notion of a
returning hero is itself a late one. Quite the contrary; and the
question then to be answered is, Where was that kind of hero supposed
to pass his time till his return? There is only one answer to which
Welsh folklore points, and that is, In fairyland. This is also the
teaching of the ancient legend about Arthur, who goes away to the Isle
of Avallon to be healed of his wounds by the fairy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>maiden Morgen; and, according to an anonymous
poet<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3718src" href="#xd26e3718" name=
"xd26e3718src">29</a>, it is in her charms that one should look for the
reason why Arthur tarries so long:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Here may be cited by way of comparison Walter
Mapes&rsquo; statement as to the Trinio, concerning whom he was quoted
in the first chapter, p. 72 above. He says, that as Trinio was never
seen after the losing battle, in which he and his friends had engaged
with a neighbouring chieftain, it was believed in the district around
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on, that Trinio&rsquo;s fairy mother had rescued
him from the enemy and taken him away with her to her home in the lake.
In the case of Arthur it is, as we have seen, a fairy also or a lake
lady that intervenes; and there cannot be much room for doubt, that the
story representing him going to fairyland to be healed is far older
than any which pictures him sleeping in a cave with his warriors and
his gold all around him. As for the gold, however, it is abundantly
represented as nowhere more common than in the home of the fairies: so
this metal treated as a test cannot greatly help us in essaying the
distinction here suggested. With regard to Owen Lawgoch, however, one
is not forced to suppose that he was ever believed to have sojourned in
Faery: the legendary precedent of Arthur as a cave sleeper would
probably suffice to open the door for him to enter the recesses of
Craig y &#272;inas, as soon as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497"
href="#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span>the country folk began to
grow weary of waiting for his return. In other words, most of our cave
legends have combined together two sets of popular belief originally
distinct, the one referring to a hero gone to the world of the fairies
and expected some day to return, and the other to a hero or god
enjoying an enchanted sleep with his retinue all around him. In some of
our legends, however, such as that of &#7930;anciau Eryri, the process
of combining the two sets of story has been left to this day
incomplete. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=

Derfel Hughes&rsquo; <i lang="cy">&#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>, p. 53. As to Drystan it is the Pictish name
<i>Drostan</i>, but a kindred form occurs in Cornwall on a stone near
Fowey, where years ago I guessed the ancient genitive <i>Drustagni</i>;
and after examining it recently I am able to confirm my original guess.
The name of Drystan recalls that of Essy&#7931;t, which offers some
difficulty. It first occurs in Welsh in the Nennian Genealogies in the
Harleian MS. 3859: see Pedigree I in the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 169,
where we read that Mermin (Merfyn) was son of Etthil daughter of Cinnan
(Cynan), who succeeded his father Rhodri Molwynog in the sovereignty of
Gwyne&#273; in 754. The spelling <i>Etthil</i> is to be regarded like
that of the Welsh names in Nennius, for some instances of which see
&sect; 73 (quoted in the next chapter) and the Old Welsh words
<i>calaur</i>, <i>nouel</i>, <i>patel</i>, so spelt in the Juvencus
Codex: see Skene, ii. 2: in all these <i>l</i> does duty for
<i>&#7931;</i>. So <i>Etthil</i> is to be treated as pronounced
Ethi&#7931; or Ethy&#7931;; but Jesus College MS. 20 gives a more
ancient pronunciation (at least as regards the consonants) when it
calls Cynan&rsquo;s daughter <i>Ethe&#7931;t</i>: see the
<i>Cymmrodor</i>, viii. 87. Powell, in his <i>History of Wales</i> by
Caradog of &#7930;ancarfan, as edited by Wynne, writes the name
<i>Esylht</i>; and the Medieval Welsh spelling has usually been
<i>Essy&#7931;t</i> or <i>Esy&#7931;t</i>, which agrees in its sibilant
with the French <i>Iselt</i> or <i>Iseut</i>; but who made the
Breton-looking change from <i>Eth</i> to <i>Es</i> or <i>Is</i> in this
name remains a somewhat doubtful point. Professor Zimmer, in the
<i lang="de">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r franz&ouml;sische Sprache und
Litteratur</i>, xiii. 73&ndash;5, points out that the name is an
Anglo-Saxon <i>Ethylda</i> borrowed, which he treats as a
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Kurzform f&uuml;r
<i>Ethelhild</i></span>&rsquo;: see also the <i lang="fr">Revue
Celtique</i>, xii. 397, xiii. 495. The adoption of this name in Wales
may be regarded as proof of intermarriage or alliance between an
English family and the royal house of Gwyne&#273; as early as the
eighth century.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

o&rsquo;i Fywyd, wedi eu tynu a&#7931;an o Lyfr y Daroganau &hellip;
Caerfyr&#273;in &hellip; Pris dwy Geiniog</i>. It has no date, but Mr.
Fisher once had a copy with the date 1847. Recently he has come across
another versified prophecy written in the same style as the printed
ones, and referring to an Owain who may have been Owen Lawgoch. The
personage meant is compared to the most brilliant of pearls, <i lang=
"cy">Owain glain golyaf</i>. The prophecy is to be found at the Swansea
Public Library, and occurs in a seventeenth century manuscript manual
of Roman Catholic Devotion, Latin and Welsh. It gives 1440 as the year
of the deliverance of the <i>Brytaniaid</i>. It forms the first of two
poems (fo. 37), the second of which is ascribed to Taliessin. Such is
Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s account of it, and the lines which he has copied for
me cling to the same theme of the ultimate triumph of the Kymry. Quite
recently I have received further information as to these prophecies
from Mr. J. H. Davies, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn (p. 354), who will, it is
to be hoped, soon publish the results of his intimate study of their
history in South Wales.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Owen the only Welshman in the king of France&rsquo;s service: there was
Owen&rsquo;s chaplain, who on one occasion distinguished himself
greatly in battle. He is called in Froissart&rsquo;s text David House,

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489n" href="#pb489n" name=

the original destination of the flotilla, see Kervyn de
Lettenhove&rsquo;s edition of Froissart (Brussels, 1870&ndash;7), viii.
435&ndash;7, where the editor has brought together several notes, from
which it appears that Owen tried unsuccessfully to recruit an army in
Spain, but that he readily got together in France a considerable force.
For Charles V, on May 8, 1372, ordered the formation of an army, to be
placed under Owen&rsquo;s command for the reconquest of his
ancestors&rsquo; lands in Wales, and two days later Owen issued a
declaration as to his Welsh claims and his obligations to the French
king; but the flotilla stopped short with Guernsey. It is not
improbable, however, that the fear in England of a descent on Wales by
Owen began at least as early as 1369. In his declaration Owen calls
himself <i>Evain de Gales</i>, which approaches the Welsh spelling
<i>Ewein</i>, more frequently <i>Ywein</i>, modern <i>Ywain</i>, except
that all these forms tended to be supplanted by <i>Owain</i> or
<i>Owen</i>. This last is, strictly speaking, the colloquial form, just
as <i>Howel</i> is the colloquial form of <i>Hywel</i>, and
<i>bowyd</i> of <i>bywyd</i>, &lsquo;life.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class=

66&ndash;71, 84, 122, 190, and ix. pp. 74&ndash;9, where a summary is
given of his life and a complete account of his death. In Lord
Berners&rsquo; translation, published in Henry VIII&rsquo;s time, Owen
is called Yuan of Wales, as if anybody could even glance at the
romances without finding that <i>Owen ab Urien</i>, for instance,
became in French <i>Ywains</i> or <i lang="fr">Ivains le fils Urien</i>
in the nominative, and <i>Ywain</i> or <i>Ivain</i> in r&eacute;gime.
Thomas Johnes of Hafod, whose translation was published in
1803&ndash;6, betrays still greater ignorance by giving him the modern
name <i>Evan</i>; but he had the excuse of being himself a

Miss &#7930;wyd, states that it was in a Hengwrt MS. she found the
identification of Owen Lawgoch. The editor surmises that to refer to p.

has already been undertaken: on Feb. 7, 1900, a summary of this chapter
was read to a meeting of the Hon. Society of Cymmrodorion, and six
weeks later Mr. Edward Owen, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, read an elaborate
paper in which he essayed to fix more exactly Yvain de Galles&rsquo;
place in the history of Wales. It would be impossible here to do
justice to his reasoning, based as it was on a careful study of the
records in point. Let it suffice for the present, however, that the
paper will in due course appear in the Society&rsquo;s
<i>Transactions</i>. Mr. J. H. Davies also informs me that he is
bringing together items of evidence, which tend, as he thinks, to show
that Miss &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s information was practically correct.
Before, however, the question can be considered satisfactorily
answered, some explanation will have to be offered of Froissart&rsquo;s
statement, that Yvain&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name was
Aymon.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e3663src">&uarr;</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the previous chapters some folklore has been
produced in which we have swine figuring: see more especially that
concerned with the Hwch &#272;u Gwta, pp. 224&ndash;6 above. Now I wish
to bring before the reader certain other groups of swine legends not
vouched for by oral tradition so much as found in manuscripts more or
less ancient. The first three to be mentioned occur in one of the
Triads<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3782src" href="#xd26e3782" name=
"xd26e3782src">1</a>. I give the substance of it in the three best
known versions, premising <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href=
"#pb499" name="pb499">499</a>]</span>that the Triad is entitled that of
the Three Stout Swineherds of the Isle of Prydain:&mdash;</p>
<p>i. 30<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;Drystan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3814src"
href="#xd26e3814" name="xd26e3814src">2</a> son of Ta&#7931;wch who
guarded the swine of March son of Meirchion while the swineherd went to
bid Essy&#7931;t come to meet him: at the same time Arthur sought to
have one sow by fraud or force, and failed.</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;Drystan son of Ta&#7931;wch with the swine
of March ab Meirchion while the swineherd went on a message to
Essy&#7931;t. Arthur and March and Cai and Bedwyr came all four to him,
but obtained from Drystan not even as much as a single porker, whether
by force, by fraud, or by theft.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;The third was Trystan son of
Ta&#7931;wch, who guarded the swine of March son of Meirchion while the
swineherd had gone on a message to Essy&#7931;t to bid her appoint a
meeting with Trystan. Now Arthur and Marche&#7931; and Cai and Bedwyr
undertook to go and make an attempt on him, but they proved unable to
get possession of as much as one porker either as a gift or as a
purchase, whether by fraud, by force, or by theft.</p>
<p>In this story the well-known love of Drystan and Essy&#7931;t is
taken for granted; but the whole setting is so peculiar and so unlike
that of the story of Tristan and Iselt or Iseut in the romances, that
there is no reason to suppose it in any way derived from the
latter.</p>
<p>The next portion of the Triad runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 30<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;And Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931; of Annwvyn who
guarded the swine of Pendaran of Dyfed in the Glen of the Cuch in
Emlyn.</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931; Head of Annwn
with the swine of Pendaran of Dyfed his foster father. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>swine were the seven brought away by Pwy&#7931;
Head of Annwn and given by him to Pendaran of Dyfed his foster father;
and the Glen of the Cuch was the place where they were kept. The reason
why Pryderi is called a mighty swineherd is that no one could prevail
over him either by fraud or by force<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3846src" href="#xd26e3846" name="xd26e3846src">3</a>.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;The first was Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931;
of Pendaran in Dyfed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3867src" href=
"#xd26e3867" name="xd26e3867src">4</a>, who guarded his father&rsquo;s
swine while he was in Annwn, and it was in the Glen of the Cuch that he
guarded them.</p>
<p>The history of the pigs is given, so to say, in the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. Pwy&#7931; had been able to strike up a friendship
and even an alliance with Arawn king of Annwvyn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3875src" href="#xd26e3875" name="xd26e3875src">5</a> or Annwn,
which now means Hades or the other world; and they kept up their
friendship partly by exchanging presents of horses, greyhounds,
falcons, and any other things calculated to give gratification to the
receiver of them. Among other gifts which Pryderi appears to have
received from the king of Annwn were <i>hobeu</i> or <i>moch</i>,
&lsquo;pigs, swine,&rsquo; which had never before been heard of in the
island of Prydain. The news about this new race of animals, and that
they formed sweeter food than oxen, was not long before it reached
Gwyne&#273;; and we shall presently see that there was another story
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501</a>]</span>flatly contradicts this part of the Triad,
namely to the effect that Gwydion, nephew of Math king of Gwyne&#273;
and a great magician, came to Pryderi&rsquo;s court at Rhu&#273;lan,
near Dolau Bach or Highmead on the Teifi in what is now the county of
Cardigan, and obtained some of the swine by deceiving the king. But, to
pass by that for the present, I may say that Dyfed seems to have been
famous for rearing swine; and at the present day one affects to believe
in the neighbouring districts that the chief industry in Dyfed, more
especially in South Cardiganshire, consists in the rearing of parsons,
carpenters, and pigs. Perhaps it is also worth mentioning that the
people of the southern portion of Dyfed are nicknamed by the men of
Glamorgan to this day <i>Moch Sir Benfro</i>, &lsquo;the Pigs of
Pembrokeshire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But why so much importance attached to pigs? I cannot well give a
better answer than the reader can himself supply if he will only
consider what r&ocirc;le the pig plays in the domestic economy of
modern Ireland. But, to judge from old Irish literature, it was even
more so in ancient times, as pigs&rsquo; meat was so highly
appreciated, that under some one or other of its various names it
usually takes its place at the head of all flesh meats in Irish
stories. This seems the case, for instance, in the medieval story
called the Vision of MacConglinne<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3917src"
href="#xd26e3917" name="xd26e3917src">6</a>; and, to go further back,
to the Feast of Bricriu for instance, one finds it decidedly the case
with the Champion&rsquo;s Portion<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3920src"
href="#xd26e3920" name="xd26e3920src">7</a> at that stormy banquet.
Then one may mention the story of the fatal feast on
Mac-D&aacute;th&oacute;&rsquo;s great swine<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3929src" href="#xd26e3929" name="xd26e3929src">8</a>, where that
beast would have apparently sufficed for the braves both of Connaught
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
"pb502">502</a>]</span>and Ulster had Conall Cernach carved fair, and
not given more than their share to his own Ultonian friends in order to
insult the Connaught men by leaving them nothing but the fore-legs. It
is right, however, to point out that most of the stories go to show,
that the gourmands of ancient Erin laid great stress on the pig being
properly fed, chiefly on milk and the best kind of meal. It cannot have
been very different in ancient Wales; for we read in the story of
Peredur that, when he sets out from his mother&rsquo;s home full of his
mother&rsquo;s counsel, he comes by-and-by to a pavilion, in front of
which he sees food, some of which he proceeds to take according to his
mother&rsquo;s advice, though the gorgeously dressed lady sitting near
it has not the politeness to anticipate his wish. It consisted, we are
told, of two bottles of wine, two loaves of white bread, and collops of
a milk-fed pig&rsquo;s flesh<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3934src" href=
"#xd26e3934" name="xd26e3934src">9</a>. The home of the fairies was
imagined to be a land of luxury and happiness with which nothing could
compare in this world. In this certain Welsh and Irish stories agree;
and in one of the latter, where the king of the fairies is trying to
persuade the queen of Ireland to elope with him, we find that among the
many inducements offered her are fresh pig, sweet milk, and
ale<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3966src" href="#xd26e3966" name=
"xd26e3966src">10</a>. Conversely, as the fairies were considered to be
always living and to be a very old-fashioned and ancient people,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=
"pb503">503</a>]</span>it was but natural to suppose that they had the
animals which man found useful, such as horses, cattle, and sheep,
except that they were held to be of superior breeds, as they are
represented, for instance, in our lake legends. Similarly, it is
natural enough that other stories should ascribe to them also the
possession of herds of swine; and all this prior to man&rsquo;s having
any. The next step in the reasoning would be that man had obtained his
from the fairies. It is some tradition of this kind that possibly
suggested the line taken by the Pwy&#7931; story in the matter of the
derivation of the pig from Annwn: see the last chapter.</p>
<p>The next story in the Triad is, if possible, wilder still: it runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>i. 30<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;frewi<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3987src" href="#xd26e3987" name=
"xd26e3987src">11</a> who guarded Henwen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3995src" href="#xd26e3995" name="xd26e3995src">12</a>,
Da&#7931;weir Da&#7931;ben&rsquo;s sow, which went burrowing as far as
the Headland of Awstin in Kernyw and then took to the sea. It was at
Aber Torogi in Gwent Is-coed that she came to land, with Co&#7931;
keeping his grip on her bristles whatever way she went by sea or by
land. Now in Maes Gwenith, &lsquo;Wheat Field,&rsquo; in Gwent she
dropped a grain of wheat and a bee, and thenceforth that has been the
best place for wheat. Then she went as far as &#7930;onwen in Penfro
and there dropped a grain of barley and a bee, and thenceforth
&#7930;onwen has been the best place for barley. Then she proceeded to
Rhiw Gyferthwch in Eryri and dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick.
These Co&#7931; gave away, the eagle to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504" name=
"pb504">504</a>]</span>Goidel Brynach from the North, and the wolf to
Menwaed of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and they came to be known as
Menwaed&rsquo;s Wolf and Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle. Then the sow went as
far as the Maen Du at &#7930;anfair in Arfon, and there she dropped a
kitten, and that kitten Co&#7931; cast into the Menai: that came later
to be known as Cath Paluc, &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;The third was Co&#7931; son of
Ka&#7931;ureuy with the swine of Da&#7931;wyr Da&#7931;ben in
Da&#7931;wyr&rsquo;s Glen in Kernyw. Now one of the swine was with
young and Henwen was her name; and it was foretold that the Isle of
Prydain would be the worse for her litter; and Arthur collected the
host of Prydain and went about to destroy it. Then one sow went
burrowing, and at the Headland of Hawstin in Kernyw she took to the sea
with the swineherd following her. And in Maes Gwenith in Gwent she
dropped a grain of wheat and a bee, and ever since Maes Gwenith is the
best place for wheat and bees. And at &#7930;onyon in Penfro she
dropped a grain of barley and another of wheat: therefore the barley of
&#7930;onyon has passed into a proverb. And on Rhiw Gyferthwch in Arfon
she dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. The wolf was given to
Mergaed and the eagle to Breat a prince from the North, and they were
the worse for having them. And at &#7930;anfair in Arfon, to wit below
the Maen Du, she dropped a kitten, and from the Maen Du the swineherd
cast it into the sea, but the sons of Paluc reared it to their
detriment. It grew to be Cath Paluc, &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat,&rsquo;
and proved one of the three chief molestations of Mona reared in the
island: the second was Daronwy and the third was Edwin king of
England.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;The second was Co&#7931; son of
Co&#7931;frewi who guarded Da&#7931;waran Da&#7931;ben&rsquo;s sow,
that came burrowing as far as the Headland of Penwedic in Kernyw and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span>then took to the sea; and she came to land at
Aber Tarogi in Gwent Is-coed with Co&#7931; keeping his hold of her
bristles whithersoever she went on sea or land. At Maes Gwenith in
Gwent she dropped three grains of wheat and three bees, and ever since
Gwent has the best wheat and bees. From Gwent she proceeded to Dyfed
and dropped a grain of barley and a porker, and ever since Dyfed has
the best barley and pigs: it was in &#7930;onnio &#7930;onnwen these
were dropped. Afterwards she proceeded to Arfon (<i>sic</i>) and in
&#7930;eyn she dropped the grain of rye, and ever since &#7930;eyn and
Eifiony&#273; have the best rye. And on the side of Rhiw Gyferthwch she
dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. Co&#7931; gave the eagle to
Brynach the Goidel of Dinas Affaraon, and the wolf to Menwaed lord of
Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and one often hears of Brynach&rsquo;s Wolf and
Menwaed&rsquo;s Eagle [the writer was careless: he has made the owners
exchange pests]. Then she went as far as the Maen Du in Arfon, where
she dropped a kitten and Co&#7931; cast it into the Menai. That was the
Cath Balwg (<i>sic</i>), &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat&rsquo;: it proved a
molestation to the Isle of Mona subsequently.</p>
<p>Such are the versions we have of this story, and a few notes on the
names seem necessary before proceeding further. Co&#7931; is called
Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;urewy in i. 30, and Co&#7931; son of
Ka&#7931;ureuy in ii. 56: all that is known of him comes from other
Triads, i. 32&ndash;3, ii. 20, and iii. 90. The first two tell us that
he was one of the Three chief Enchanters of the Isle of Prydain, and
that he was taught his magic by Rhu&#273;lwm the Giant; while ii. 20
calls the latter a dwarf and adds that Co&#7931; was nephew to him. The
matter is differently put in iii. 90, to the effect that Rhu&#273;lwm
the Giant learnt his magic from Ei&#273;[il]ig the Dwarf and from
Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;frewi. Nothing is known of
Da&#7931;wyr&rsquo;s Glen in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506" href=
"#pb506" name="pb506">506</a>]</span>Kernyw, or of the person after
whom it was named. Kernyw is the Welsh for Cornwall, but if Penryn
Awstin or Hawstin is to be identified with Aust Cliff on the Severn Sea
in Gloucestershire, the story would seem to indicate a time when
Cornwall extended north-eastwards as far as that point. The later
Triad, iii. 101, avoids Penryn Awstin and substitutes Penwe&#273;ic,
which recalls some such a name as Pengwaed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4037src" href="#xd26e4037" name="xd26e4037src">13</a> or Penwith
in Cornwall: elsewhere Penwe&#273;ic<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4046src" href="#xd26e4046" name="xd26e4046src">14</a> is only
given as the name of the most northern hundred of Keredigion. Gwent
Is-coed means Gwent below the Wood or Forest, and Aber Torogi or
Tarogi&mdash;omitted, probably by accident, in ii. 56&mdash;is now
Caldicot Pill, where the small river Tarogi, now called Troggy,
discharges itself not very far from Portskewet. Maes Gwenith in the
same neighbourhood is still known by that name. The correct spelling of
the name of the place in Penfro was probably &#7930;onyon, but it is
variously given as &#7930;onwen, &#7930;onyon, and &#7930;onion, not to
mention the &#7930;onnio &#7930;onnwen of the later form of the Triad:
should this last prove to be based on any authority one might suggest
&#7930;onyon Henwen, so called after the sow, as the original. The
modern Welsh spelling of &#7930;onyon would be &#7930;onion, and it is
identified by Mr. Egerton Phillimore with Lanion near Pembroke<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4055src" href="#xd26e4055" name=
"xd26e4055src">15</a>. Rhiw Gyferthwch is guessed to have been one of
the slopes of Snowdon on the Be&#273;gelert side; but I have failed to
discover anybody who has ever heard the name used in that
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Ar&#7931;echwe&#273; was, roughly speaking, that part of
Carnarvonshire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href="#pb507" name=
"pb507">507</a>]</span>which drains into the sea between Conway and
Bangor. Brynach and Menwaed or Mengwaed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4065src" href="#xd26e4065" name="xd26e4065src">16</a> seem to be
the names underlying the misreadings in ii. 56; but it is quite
possible that Brynach, probably for an Irish Bronach, has here
superseded an earlier Urnach or Eurnach also a Goidel, to whom I shall
have to return in another chapter. Dinas Affaraon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4128src" href="#xd26e4128" name="xd26e4128src">17</a> is the
place called <i lang="cy">Dinas Ffaraon Dande</i> in the story of
&#7930;ud and &#7930;evelys, where we are told that after &#7930;ud had
had the two dragons buried there, which had been dug up at the centre
of his realm, to wit at Oxford, Ffaraon, after whom the place was
called, died of grief. Later it came to be called Dinas Emrys from
Myr&#273;in Emrys, &lsquo;Merlinus Ambrosius,&rsquo; who induced
Vortigern to go away from there in quest of another place to build his
castle<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4137src" href="#xd26e4137" name=
"xd26e4137src">18</a>. So the reader will see that the mention of this
Dinas brings us back to a weird spot with which he has been
familiarized in the previous chapter: see pp. 469, 495 above.
&#7930;anfair in Arfon is &#7930;anfair Is-gaer near Port Dinorwic on
the Menai Straits, and the Maen Du should be a black rock or black
stone on the southern side of those straits. Daronwy and Cath Paluc are
both personages on whom light is still wanted. Lastly, by Edwin king of
England is to be understood Edwin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508"
href="#pb508" name="pb508">508</a>]</span>king of the Angles of Deira
and Bernicia, whom Welsh tradition represents as having found refuge
for a time in Anglesey.</p>
<p>Now this story as a whole looks like a sort of device for stringing
together explanations of the origin of certain place-names and of
certain local characteristics. Leaving entirely out of the reckoning
the whole of Mid-Wales, that is to say, the more Brythonic portion of
the country, it is remarkable as giving to South Wales credit for
certain resources, but to North Wales for pests alone and scourges,
except that the writer of the late version bethought himself of
&#7930;eyn and Eifiony&#273; as having good land for growing rye; but
he was very hazy as to the geography of North Wales&mdash;both he and
the redactors of the other Triads equally belonged doubtless to South
Wales. Among the place-names, Maes Gwenith, &lsquo;the Wheat
Field,&rsquo; is clear; but hardly less so is the case of Aber Torogi,
&lsquo;Mouth of the Troggy,&rsquo; where <i>torogi</i> is &lsquo;the
pregnancy of animals,&rsquo; from <i>torrog</i>, &lsquo;being with
young.&rsquo; So with Rhiw Gyferthwch, &lsquo;the Hillside or Ascent of
<i>Cyferthwch</i>,&rsquo; where <i>cyferthwch</i> means
&lsquo;pantings, pangs, labour.&rsquo; The name Maen Du, &lsquo;Black
Rock,&rsquo; is left to explain itself; and I am not sure that the
original story was not so put as also to explain <i>&#7930;onion</i>,
to wit, as a sort of plural of <i>&#7931;awn</i>, &lsquo;full,&rsquo;
in reference, let us say, to the full ears of the barley grown there.
But the reference to the place-names seems to have partly escaped the
later tellers of the story or to have failed to impress them as worth
emphasizing. They appear to have thought more of explaining the origin
of Menwaed&rsquo;s Wolf and Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle. Whether this means
in the former case that the district of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273; was more
infested by wolves than any other part of Wales, or that Menwaed, lord
of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, had a wolf as his symbol, it is impossible to
say. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href="#pb509" name=
"pb509">509</a>]</span>In another Triad, however, i. 23 = ii. 57, he is
reckoned one of the Three Battle-knights who were favourites at
Arthur&rsquo;s court, the others being Caradog Freichfras and &#7930;yr
&#7930;&uuml;y&#273;og or &#7930;u&#273; &#7930;urugog, while in iii.
29 Menwaed&rsquo;s place is taken by a son of his called Mael Hir.
Similarly with regard to Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle one has nothing to say,
except that common parlance some time or other would seem to have
associated the eagle in some way with Brynach the Goidel. The former
prevalence of the eagle in the Snowdon district seems to be the
explanation of its Welsh name of Eryri&mdash;as already suggested, p.
479 above&mdash;and the association of the bird with the Goidelic
chieftain who had his stronghold under the shadow of Snowdon seems to
follow naturally enough. But the details are conspicuous by their
scarcity in Welsh literature, though Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle is probably
to be identified with the <i lang="la">Aquila Fabulosa</i> of Eryri, of
which Giraldus makes a curious mention<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4175src" href="#xd26e4175" name="xd26e4175src">19</a>. Perhaps
the final disuse of Goidelic speech in the district is to be, to some
extent, regarded as accounting for our dearth of data. A change of
language involved in all probability the shipwreck of many a familiar
mode of thought; and many a homely expression must have been lost in
the transition before an equivalent acceptable to the Goidel was
discovered by him in his adopted idiom.</p>
<p>This question of linguistic change will be found further illustrated
by the story to which I wish now to pass, namely that of the hunting of
Twrch Trwyth. It is one of those incorporated in the larger tale known
as that of Kulhwch and Olwen, the hero and heroine concerned: see the
Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 135&ndash;41, and Guest&rsquo;s
translation, iii. 306&ndash;16. Twrch Trwyth is pictured as a
formidable boar at the head of his offspring, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb510" href="#pb510" name=
"pb510">510</a>]</span>consisting of seven swine, and the Twrch himself
is represented as carrying between his ears a comb, a razor, and a pair
of shears. The plot of the Kulhwch renders it necessary that these
precious articles should be procured; so Kulhwch prevails on his cousin
Arthur to undertake the hunt. Arthur began by sending one of his men,
to wit, Menw<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4187src" href="#xd26e4187"
name="xd26e4187src">20</a> son of Teirgwae&#273;, to see whether the
three precious things mentioned were really where they were said to be,
namely, between Twrch Trwyth&rsquo;s ears. Menw was a great magician
who usually formed one of any party of Arthur&rsquo;s men about to
visit a pagan country; for it was his business to subject the
inhabitants to magic and enchantment, so that they should not see
Arthur&rsquo;s men, while the latter saw them. Menw found Twrch Trwyth
and his offspring at a place in Ireland called Esgeir Oervel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4199src" href="#xd26e4199" name=
"xd26e4199src">21</a>, and in order to approach them he alighted in the
form of a bird near where they were. He tried to snatch one of the
three precious articles from Twrch Trwyth, but he only succeeded in
securing one of his bristles, whereupon the Twrch stood up and shook
himself so vigorously that a drop of venom from his bristles fell on
Menw, who never enjoyed a day&rsquo;s health afterwards as long as he
lived. Menw now returned and assured Arthur that the treasures were
really about the Twrch&rsquo;s head as it was reported. Arthur then
crossed to Ireland with a host and did not stop until he found Twrch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb511" href="#pb511" name=
"pb511">511</a>]</span>Trwyth and his swine at Esgeir Oervel. The hunt
began and was continued for several days, but it did not prevent the
Twrch from laying waste <i>a fifth part</i> of Ireland, that is in
Medieval Irish <i>c&oacute;iced</i>, a province of the island.
Arthur&rsquo;s men, however, succeeded in killing one of the
Twrch&rsquo;s offspring, and they asked Arthur the history<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4217src" href="#xd26e4217" name=
"xd26e4217src">22</a> of that swine. Arthur replied that it had been a
king before being transformed by God into a swine on account of his
sins. Here I should remark by the way, that the narrator of the story
forgets the death of this young boar, and continues to reckon the
Twrch&rsquo;s herd as seven.</p>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s next move was to send one of his men, Gwrhyr,
interpreter of tongues<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4229src" href=
"#xd26e4229" name="xd26e4229src">23</a>, to parley with the boars.
Gwrhyr, in the form of a bird, alighted above where Twrch Trwyth and
his swine lay, and addressed them as follows: &lsquo;For the sake of
Him who fashioned you in this shape, if you can speak, I ask one of you
to come to converse with Arthur.&rsquo; Answer was made by one of the
boars, called Grugyn Gwrych Ereint, that is, Grugyn Silver-bristle; for
like feathers of silver, we are told, were his bristles wherever he
went, and whether in woods or on plains, one saw the gleam of his
bristles. The following, then, was Grugyn&rsquo;s answer: &lsquo;By Him
who fashioned us in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512"
name="pb512">512</a>]</span>this shape, we shall not do so, and we
shall not converse with Arthur. Enough evil has God done to us when He
fashioned us in this shape, without your coming to fight with
us.&rsquo; Gwrhyr replied: &lsquo;I tell you that Arthur will fight for
the comb, the razor, and the shears that are between the ears of Twrch
Trwyth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Until his life has first been taken,&rsquo; said
Grugyn, &lsquo;those trinkets shall not be taken, and to-morrow morning
we set out hence for Arthur&rsquo;s own country, and all the harm we
can, shall we do there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boars accordingly set out for Wales, while Arthur with his host,
his horses, and his hounds, on board his ship <i>Prydwen</i>, kept
within sight of them. Twrch Trwyth came to land at Porth Clais, a small
creek south of St. David&rsquo;s, but Arthur went that night to Mynyw,
which seems to have been Menevia or St. David&rsquo;s. The next day
Arthur was told that the boars had gone past, and he overtook them
killing the herds of Kynnwas Cwrvagyl, after they had destroyed all
they could find in Deugle&#273;yf, whether man or beast. Then the Twrch
went as far as Presseleu, a name which survives in that of Preselly or
Precelly, as in Preselly Top and Preselly Mountains in North
Pembrokeshire. Arthur and his men began the hunt again, while his
warriors were ranged on both sides of the <i>Nyfer</i> or the river
Nevern. The Twrch then left the Glen of the Nevern and made his way to
Cwm Kerwyn, the name of which survives in that of Moel Cwm Kerwyn, one
of the Preselly heights. In the course of the hunt in that district the
Twrch killed Arthur&rsquo;s four champions and many of the people of
the country. He was next overtaken in a district called
Peuliniauc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4257src" href="#xd26e4257" name=
"xd26e4257src">24</a> or Peuliniog, which appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name="pb513">513</a>]</span>to
have occupied a central area between the mountains, &#7930;an&#273;ewi
Velfrey, Hen&#7931;an Amgoed, and Laugharne: it probably covered
portions of the parish of Whitland and of that of &#7930;andysilio, the
church of which is a little to the north of the railway station of Clyn
Derwen on the Great Western line. Leaving Peuliniog for the Laugharne
Burrows, he crossed, as it seems, from Ginst Point to <i lang="cy">Aber
Towy</i> or Towy Mouth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4287src" href=
"#xd26e4287" name="xd26e4287src">25</a>, which at low water are
separated mostly by tracts of sand interrupted only by one or two
channels of no very considerable width; for Aber Towy would seem to
have been a little south-east of St. Ishmael&rsquo;s, on the eastern
bank of the Towy. Thence the Twrch makes his way to <i lang="cy">Glynn
Ystu</i>, more correctly perhaps <i lang="cy">Clyn Ystun</i>, now
written <i lang="cy">Clyn Ystyn</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4301src"
href="#xd26e4301" name="xd26e4301src">26</a>, the name of a farm
between Carmarthen and the junction of the Amman with the &#7930;ychwr,
more exactly about six miles from that junction and about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514" name=
"pb514">514</a>]</span>eight and a half from Carmarthen as the crow
flies. The hunt is resumed in the Valley of the &#7930;ychwr or
Loughor<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4345src" href="#xd26e4345" name=
"xd26e4345src">27</a>, where Grugyn and another young boar, called
&#7930;wydawc Gouynnyat<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4370src" href=
"#xd26e4370" name="xd26e4370src">28</a>, committed terrible ravages
among the huntsmen. This brought Arthur and his host to the rescue, and
Twrch Trwyth, on his part, came to help his boars; but as a tremendous
attack was now made on him he moved away, leaving the &#7930;ychwr, and
making eastwards for Myny&#273; Amanw, or &lsquo;the Mountain of
Amman,&rsquo; for Amanw is plentifully preserved in that neighbourhood
in the shortened form of Aman or Amman<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4394src" href="#xd26e4394" name="xd26e4394src">29</a>. On
Myny&#273; Amanw one of his boars was killed, but he is not
distinguished by any proper name: he is simply called a <i>banw</i>,
&lsquo;a young boar.&rsquo; The Twrch was again hard pressed, and lost
another called Twrch &#7930;awin. Then a third of the swine is killed,
called Gwys, whereupon Twrch Trwyth went to Dyffryn Amanw, or the Vale
of Amman, where he lost a <i>banw</i> and a <i>benwic</i>, a
&lsquo;boar&rsquo; and a &lsquo;sow.&rsquo; All this evidently takes
place in the same district, and Myny&#273; Amanw was, if not Bryn
Amman, probably one of the mountains to the south or south-east of the
river Amman, so that Dyffryn Amanw may have been what is still called
Dyffryn Amman, or the Valley of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb515" href="#pb515" name="pb515">515</a>]</span>Amman from Bryn Amman
to where the river Amman falls into the &#7930;ychwr. From the Amman
the Twrch and the two remaining boars of his herd made their way to
&#7930;wch Ewin, &lsquo;the lake or pool of Ewin,&rsquo; which is now
represented by a bog mere above a farm house called &#7930;wch in the
parish of Bettws, which covers the southern slope of the Amman Valley.
I have found this bog called in a map <i lang="cy">&#7930;wch is
Awel</i>, &lsquo;Pool below Breeze,&rsquo; whatever that may mean.</p>
<p>We find them next at <i lang="cy">&#7930;wch Tawi</i>, the position
of which is indicated by that of <i lang="cy">Ynys Pen &#7930;wch</i>,
&lsquo;Pool&rsquo;s End Isle,&rsquo; some distance lower down the Tawe
than Pont ar Dawe. At this point the boars separate, and Grugyn goes
away to Din Tywi, &lsquo;Towy Fort,&rsquo; an unidentified position
somewhere on the Towy, possibly Grongar Hill near &#7930;andeilo, and
thence to a place in Keredigion where he was killed, namely, Garth
Grugyn. I have not yet been able to identify the spot, though it must
have once had a castle, as we read of a castle called Garthgrugyn being
strengthened by Maelgwn Vychan in the year 1242: the <i>Bruts</i>
locate it in Keredigion<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4435src" href=
"#xd26e4435" name="xd26e4435src">30</a>, but this part of the story is
obscured by careless copying on the part of the scribe<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4447src" href="#xd26e4447" name=
"xd26e4447src">31</a> of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href=
"#pb516" name="pb516">516</a>]</span><i>Red Book</i>. After
Grugyn&rsquo;s death we read of &#7930;wydawc having made his way to
Ystrad Yw, and, after inflicting slaughter on several of his
assailants, he is himself killed there. Now Ystrad Yw, which our
mapsters would have us call <i lang="cy">Ystrad Wy</i>, as if it had
been on the Wye<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4467src" href="#xd26e4467"
name="xd26e4467src">32</a>, is supposed to have covered till Henry
VIII&rsquo;s time the same area approximately as the hundred of
Crickhowel has since, namely, the parishes of (1) Crickhowel, (2)
&#7930;anbedr Ystrad Yw with Patrishow, (3) &#7930;anfihangel Cwm Du
with Tretower and Penmyarth, (4) &#7930;angattock with &#7930;angenny,
(5) &#7930;ane&#7931;y with Brynmawr, and (6) &#7930;angynidr. Of these
&#7930;anbedr perpetuates the name of Ystrad Yw, although it is
situated near the junction of the Greater and Lesser Grwyn&euml; and
not in the Strath of the Yw, which <i lang="cy">Ystrad Yw</i> means. So
one can only treat <i lang="cy">Lanbedr Ystrad Yw</i> as meaning that
particular &#7930;anbedr or St. Peter&rsquo;s Church which belongs to
the district comprehensively called Ystrad Yw. Now if one glances at
the <i>Red Book</i> list of cantreds and cymwds, dating in the latter
part of the fourteenth century, one will find <i lang="cy">Ystrad
Yw</i> and <i>Cruc Howel</i> existing as separate cymwds. So we have to
look for the former in the direction of the parish of Cwm Du; and on
going back to the <i>Taxatio</i> of Pope Nicholas IV dating about 1291,
we find that practically we have to identify with Cwm Du a name
<i>Stratden&rsquo;</i>, p. 273<sup>a</sup>, which one is probably to
treat as <i>Strat d&rsquo;Eue</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4507src"
href="#xd26e4507" name="xd26e4507src">33</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href="#pb517" name="pb517">517</a>]</span>or
some similar Norman spelling; for most of the other parishes of the
district are mentioned by the names which they still bear. That is not
all; for from Cwm Du a tributary of the Usk called the Rhiango&#7931;
comes down and receives at Tretower the waters of a smaller stream
called the Yw. The land on both sides of that Yw burn forms the
<i>ystrad</i> or strath of which we are in quest. The chief source of
this water is called <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i>, and gives its name to a
house of some pretensions bearing an inscription showing that it was
built in its present form about the middle of the seventeenth century
by a member of the Gunter family well known in the history of the
county. Near the house stands a yew tree on the boundary line of the
garden, and close to its trunk, but at a lower level, is a spring of
bubbling water: this is <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i>, &lsquo;the Eye of the
Yw.&rsquo; For <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i> is a succinct expression for the
source of the Yw burn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4540src" href=
"#xd26e4540" name="xd26e4540src">34</a>, and the stream retains the
name <i>Yw</i> to its fall into the Rhiango&#7931;; but besides the
spring of <i>Llygad Yw</i> it has several other similar sources in the
fields near the house. There is nothing, however, in this brook to
account for the name of Ystrad <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb518"
href="#pb518" name="pb518">518</a>]</span>Yw having been extended to an
important district; but if one traces its short course one will at once
guess the explanation. For a few fields below &#7930;ygad Yw is the
hamlet of the <i>Gaer</i> or fortress, consisting of four farm houses
called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Gaer, and Pen y Gaer: through this
hamlet of the Gaer flows the Yw. These, and more especially Pen y Gaer,
are supposed to have been the site of a Roman camp of considerable
importance, and close by it the Yw is supposed to have been crossed by
the Roman road proceeding towards Brecon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4605src" href="#xd26e4605" name="xd26e4605src">35</a>. The camp
in the Strath of the Yw was the head quarters of the ruling power in
the district, and hence the application of the name of Ystrad Yw to a
wider area. But for our story one has to regard the name as confined to
the land about the Yw burn, or at most to a somewhat larger portion of
the parish of Cwm Du, to which the Yw and Tretower belong. The position
of the Gaer in Ystrad Yw at the foot of the Bwlch or the gap in the
difficult mountain spur stretching down towards the Usk is more likely
to have been selected by the Romans than by any of the Celtic
inhabitants, whose works are to be found on several of the neighbouring
hills, such as Myarth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4614src" href=
"#xd26e4614" name="xd26e4614src">36</a> between the Yw and the Usk.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb519" href="#pb519" name=
"pb519">519</a>]</span></p>
<p>We next find Twrch Trwyth, now the sole survivor, making his way
towards the Severn: so Arthur summons Cornwall and Devon to meet him at
Aber Hafren or Severn mouth. Then a furious conflict with the Twrch
takes place in the very waters of that river, between &#7930;yn
&#7930;iwan (p. 407) and Aber Gwy or the mouth of the Wye. After much
trouble, Arthur&rsquo;s men succeed in getting possession of two out of
the three treasures of the boar, but he escapes with the third, namely,
the comb, across the Severn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4631src" href=
"#xd26e4631" name="xd26e4631src">37</a>. Then as soon as he gets ashore
he makes his way to Cornwall, where the comb is at length snatched from
him. Chased thence, he goes straight into the sea, with the hounds Anet
and Aethlem after him, and nothing has ever been heard of any of the
three from that day to this.</p>
<p>That is the story of Twrch Trwyth, and Dr. Stokes calls my attention
to a somewhat similar hunt briefly described in the Rennes
<i>Dinds&#775;enchas</i> in the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xv.
474&ndash;5. Then as to the precious articles carried by the Twrch
about his head and ears, the comb, the razor, and the shears, two out
of the three&mdash;the comb and the razor&mdash;belong to the regular
stock of a certain group of tales which recount how the hero elopes
with the daughter of a giant who loses his life in the pursuit<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4642src" href="#xd26e4642" name=
"xd26e4642src">38</a>. In order to make sure of escaping from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb520" href="#pb520" name=
"pb520">520</a>]</span>infuriated giant, the daughter abstracts from
her father&rsquo;s keeping a comb, a razor, and another article. When
she and her lover fleeing on their horse are hard pressed, the latter
throws behind him the comb, which at once becomes a rough impenetrable
forest to detain the giant for a while. When he is again on the point
of overtaking them, the lover throws behind him the razor, which
becomes a steep and sharp mountain ridge through which the pursuing
giant has to waste time tunnelling his way. The third article is
usually such as, when thrown in the giant&rsquo;s way, becomes a lake
in which he is drowned while attempting to swim across. In the Kulhwch
story, however, as we have it, the allusion to these objects is torn
away from what might be expected as its context. The giant is
Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr, whose death is effected in another way; but
before the giant is finally disposed of he requires to be shaved and to
have his hair dressed. His hair, moreover, is so rough that the
dressing cannot be done without the comb and shears in the possession
of Twrch Trwyth, whence the hunt; and for the shaving one would have
expected the Twrch&rsquo;s razor to have been requisite; but not so, as
the shaving had to be done by means of another article, namely, the
tusk of <i lang="cy">Yskithyrwynn Pennbei&#273;</i>, &lsquo;White-tusk
chief of Boars,&rsquo; for the obtaining of which one is treated
briefly to another boar hunt. The Kulhwch story is in this respect very
mixed and disjointed, owing, it would seem, to the determination of the
narrator to multiply the number of things difficult to procure, each
involving a separate feat to be described.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the hunt somewhat more in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521" name=
"pb521">521</a>]</span>detail, with special reference to the names
mentioned; and let us begin with that of Twrch Trwyth: the word
<i>twrch</i> means the male of a beast of the swine kind, and <i>twrch
coed</i>, &lsquo;a wood pig,&rsquo; is a wild boar, while <i>twrch
daear</i>, &lsquo;an earth pig,&rsquo; is the word in North Wales for a
mole. In the next place we can practically equate <i>Twrch Trwyth</i>
with a name at the head of one of the articles in Cormac&rsquo;s
<i>Irish Glossary</i>. There the exact form is <i>Orc
tr&eacute;ith</i>, and the following is the first part of the article
itself as given in O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s translation edited by
Stokes:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Orc Tr&eacute;ith</i>, <i>i. e. nomen</i> for a
king&rsquo;s son, <i>triath enim rex vocatur, unde dixit poeta
O&iacute;nach n-uirc tr&eacute;ith</i> &ldquo;fair of a king&rsquo;s
son,&rdquo; i. e. food and precious raiment, down and quilts, ale and
flesh-meat, chessmen and chessboards, horses and chariots, greyhounds
and playthings besides.&rsquo; In this extract the word <i>orc</i>
occurs in the genitive as <i>uirc</i>, and it means a &lsquo;pig&rsquo;
or &lsquo;boar&rsquo;; in fact it is, with the usual Celtic loss of the
consonant <i>p</i>, the exact Goidelic equivalent of the Latin
<i>porcus</i>, genitive <i>porci</i>. From another article in
Cormac&rsquo;s <i>Glossary</i>, we learn that <i>Tr&eacute;ith</i> is
the genitive of <i>Triath</i>, which has been explained to mean a king.
Thus, <i>Orc Tr&eacute;ith</i> means Triath&rsquo;s <i>Orc</i>,
Triath&rsquo;s Boar, or the King&rsquo;s Boar; so we take Twrch Trwyth
in the same way to mean &lsquo;Trwyth&rsquo;s Boar.&rsquo; But we have
here a discrepancy, which the reader will have noticed, for
<i>twrch</i> is not the same word as Irish <i>orc</i>, the nearest form
to be expected in Welsh being <i>Wrch</i>, not <i>Twrch</i>; but such a
word as <i>Wrch</i> does not, so far as I know, exist. Now did the
Welsh render <i>orc</i> by a different word unrelated to the Goidelic
one which they heard? I think not; for it is remarkable that Irish has
besides <i>orc</i> a word <i>torc</i>, meaning a &lsquo;boar,&rsquo;
and <i>torc</i> is exactly the Welsh <i>twrch</i>. So there seems to be
no objection to our supposing that what Cormac calls <i>Orc
Tr&eacute;ith</i> was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522" href=
"#pb522" name="pb522">522</a>]</span>known in the Goidelic of Wales as
<i>Torc Tr&eacute;ith</i>, which had the alliteration to recommend it
to popular favour. In that case one could say that the Goidelic name
<i>Torc Tr&eacute;ith</i> appears in Welsh with a minimum of change as
<i>Twrch Trwyth</i>, and also with the stamp of popular favour more
especially in the retention of the Goidelic <i>th</i>, just as in the
name of an ancient camp or fortification on the Withy Bush Estate in
Pembrokeshire: it is called the <i>Rath</i>, or the <i>Rath Ring</i>.
Here <i>r&#257;th</i> is identical with the Irish word <i lang=
"ga">r&aacute;th</i>, &lsquo;a fortification or earthworks,&rsquo; and
we seem to have it also in <i lang="ga">Cil R&acirc;th Fawr</i>, the
name of a farm in the neighbourhood of Narberth. Now the Goidelic word
<i>tr&eacute;ith</i> appears to have come into Welsh as
<i>tr&#275;th-i</i>, the long vowel of which must in Welsh have become
<i>oi</i> or <i>ui</i> by about the end of the sixth century; and if
the <i>th</i> had been treated on etymological principles its proper
equivalent in the Welsh of that time would have been <i>d</i> or
<i>t</i>. The retention of the <i>th</i> is a proof, therefore, of oral
transmission; that is to say, the Goidelic word passed bodily into
Brythonic, to submit afterwards to the phonological rules of that
language.</p>
<p>A little scrutiny of the tale will, I think, convince the reader
that one of the objects of the original story-teller was to account for
certain place-names. Thus Grugyn was meant to account for the name of
Garth Grugyn, where Grugyn was killed; Gwys, to account similarly for
that of Gwys, a tributary of the Twrch, which gives its name to a
station on the line of railway between Ystalyfera and Bryn Amman; and
Twrch &#7930;awin to account for the name of the river Twrch, which
receives the Gwys, and falls into the Tawe some distance below Ystrad
Gynlais, between the counties of Brecknock and Glamorgan.</p>
<p>Besides Grugyn and Twrch &#7930;awin, there was a third <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>brother to whom the story gives a special name,
to wit, &#7930;wydawc Gouynnyat, and this was, I take it, meant also to
account for a place-name, which, however, is not given: it should have
been somewhere in Ystrad Yw, in the county of Brecknock. Still greater
interest attaches to the swine that have not been favoured with names
of their own, those referred to simply as <i>banw</i>, &lsquo;a young
boar,&rsquo; and <i>benwic</i>, &lsquo;a young sow.&rsquo; Now
<i>banw</i> has its equivalent in Irish in the word <i>banbh</i>, which
O&rsquo;Reilly explains as meaning a &lsquo;sucking pig,&rsquo; and
that is the meaning also of the Manx <i>bannoo</i>; but formerly the
word may have had a somewhat wider meaning. The Welsh appellative is
introduced twice into the story of Twrch Trwyth; once to account, as I
take it, for the name Myny&#273; Amanw, &lsquo;Amman Mountain,&rsquo;
and once for Dyffryn Amanw, &lsquo;Amman Valley.&rsquo; In both
instances Amanw was meant, as I think, to be accounted for by the
<i>banw</i> killed at each of the places in question. But how, you will
ask, does the word <i>banw</i> account for <i>Amanw</i>, or throw any
light on it at all? Very simply, if you will just suppose the name to
have been Goidelic; for then you have only to provide it with the
definite article and it makes <i>in banbh</i>, &lsquo;the pig or the
boar,&rsquo; and that could not in Welsh yield anything but
<i>ymmanw</i> or <i>ammanw</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4856src"
href="#xd26e4856" name="xd26e4856src">39</a>, which with the accent
shifted backwards, became <i>Ammanw</i> and <i>Amman</i> or
<i>Aman</i>.</p>
<p>Having premised these explanations let us, before we proceed
further, see to what our evidence exactly amounts. Here, then, we have
a mention of seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb524" href="#pb524"
name="pb524">524</a>]</span>swine, but as two of them, a <i>banw</i>
and a <i>benwic</i>, are killed at one and the same place, our figure
is practically reduced to six<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4917src" href=
"#xd26e4917" name="xd26e4917src">40</a>. The question then is, in how
many of these six cases the story of the hunt accounts for the names of
the places of the deaths respectively, that is to say, accounts for
them in the ordinary way with which one is familiar in other Welsh
stories. They may be enumerated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. A <i>banw</i> is killed at Myny&#273; <i>Amanw</i>.</p>
<p>2. A <i>twrch</i> is killed in the same neighbourhood, where there
is a river <i>Twrch</i>.</p>
<p>3. A swine called <i>Gwys</i> is killed in the same neighbourhood
still, where there is a river called <i>Gwys</i>, falling into the
Twrch.</p>
<p>4. A <i>banw</i> and a <i>benwic</i> are killed in Dyffryn
<i>Amanw</i>.</p>
<p>5. Grugyn is killed at a place called Garth <i>Grugyn</i>.</p>
<p>6. A swine called &#7930;wydawc is killed at a spot, not named, in
Ystrad Yw or not far off<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4966src" href=
"#xd26e4966" name="xd26e4966src">41</a>.</p>
<p>Thus in five cases out of the six, the story accounts for the
place-name, and the question now is, can that be a mere accident? Just
think what the probabilities of the case would be if you put them into
numbers: South Wales, from St. David&rsquo;s to the Vale of the Usk,
would supply hundreds of place-names as deserving of mention, to say
the least, as those in this story; is it likely then that out of a
given six among them no less than five should be accounted for or
alluded to by any mere accident in the course of a story of the brevity
of that of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525" href="#pb525" name=
"pb525">525</a>]</span>Twrch Trwyth. To my thinking such an accident is
inconceivable, and I am forced, therefore, to suppose that the
narrative was originally so designed as to account for them. I said
&lsquo;originally so designed,&rsquo; for the scribe of the <i>Red
Book</i>, or let us say the last redactor of the story as it stands in
the <i>Red Book</i>, shows no signs of having noticed any such design.
Had he detected the play on the names of the places introduced, he
would probably have been more inclined to develop that feature of the
story than to efface it.</p>
<p>What I mean may best be illustrated by another swine story, namely,
that which has already been referred to as occurring in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Math. There we find Pryderi, king of Dyfed, holding
his court at Rhu&#273;lan on the Teifi, but though he had become the
proud possessor of a new race of animals, given him as a present by his
friend Arawn, king of Annwn, he had made a solemn promise to his
people, that he should give none of them away until they had doubled
their number in Dyfed: these animals were the <i>hobeu</i> or pigs to
which reference was made at p. 69 above. Now Gwydion, having heard of
them, visited Pryderi&rsquo;s court, and by magic and enchantment
deceived the king. Successful in his quest, he sets out for Gwyne&#273;
with his <i>hobeu</i>, and this is how his journey is described in the
<i>Mabinogi</i>: &lsquo;And that evening they journeyed as far as the
upper end of Keredigion, to a place which is still called, for that
reason, Mochdref, &ldquo;Swine-town or Pigs&rsquo; stead.&rdquo; On the
morrow they went their way, and came across the Elenyd mountains, and
that night they spent between Kerry and Arwystli, in the stead which is
also called for that reason Mochdref. Thence they proceeded, and came
the same evening as far as a commot in Powys, which is for that reason
called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526" href="#pb526" name=
"pb526">526</a>]</span>Mochnant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5018src"
href="#xd26e5018" name="xd26e5018src">42</a>, &ldquo;Swine-burn.&rdquo;
Thence they journeyed to the cantred of Rh&ocirc;s, and spent that
night within the town which is still called Mochdref<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5021src" href="#xd26e5021" name="xd26e5021src">43</a>.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ah, my men,&rsquo; said Gwydion, &lsquo;let us make for the
fastness of Gwyne&#273; with these beasts: the country is being raised
in pursuit of us.&rsquo; So this is what they did: they made for the
highest town of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and there built a <i>creu</i> or
sty for the pigs, and for that reason the town was called
<i>Creu-Wyrion</i>, that is, perhaps, &lsquo;Wyrion&rsquo;s Sty.&rsquo;
In this, it is needless to state, we have the Corwrion of chap. i: see
pp. 47, 50&ndash;70 above&mdash;the name is variously pronounced also
<i>Cyrwrion</i> and <i>C&rsquo;rwrion</i>.</p>
<p>That is how a portion of the Math story is made to account for a
series of place-names, and had the editor of the Kulhwch understood the
play on the names of places in question in the story of Twrch Trwyth,
it might be expected that he would have given it prominence, as already
suggested. Then comes the question, how it came to pass that he did not
understand it? The first thing to suggest itself as an answer is, that
he may have been a stranger to the geography of the country concerned.
That, however, is a very inadequate explanation; for his being a
stranger, though it might account for his making blunders as to the
localities, would not be likely to deter him from venturing into
geography which he had not mastered.</p>
<p>What was it, then, that hid from him a portion of the original in
this instance? In part, at least, it must have been a difficulty of
language. Let us take an illustration: Gwys has already been mentioned
more than once as a name applied to one of Twrch Trwyth&rsquo;s
offspring, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb527" href="#pb527" name=
"pb527">527</a>]</span>and the words used are very brief, to the
following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;And then another of his swine was
killed: Gwys was its name.&rsquo; As a matter of fact, the scribe was
labouring under a mistake, for he ought to have said rather, &lsquo;And
then another of his swine was killed: it was a sow&rsquo;; since
<i>gwys</i> was a word meaning a sow, and not the name of any
individual hog. The word has, doubtless, long been obsolete in Welsh;
but it was known to the poet of the &lsquo;Little Pig&rsquo;s
Lullaby&rsquo; in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, where one of the
stanzas begins, fo. 29<sup>a</sup>, with the line:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Oian aparchellan. aparchell. guin guis.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The late Dr. Pughe translated it thus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Listen, little porkling! thou forward little white
pig.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I fear I should be obliged to render it less
elegantly:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lullaby, little porker, white sow porker.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For the last four words Stokes suggests &lsquo;O
pigling of a white sow&rsquo;; but perhaps the most natural rendering
of the words would be &lsquo;O white porker of a
sow!&rsquo;&mdash;which does not recommend itself greatly on the score
of sense, I must admit. The word occurs, also, in Breton as <i>gwiz</i>
or <i>gw&eacute;z</i>, &lsquo;truie, femelle du porc,&rsquo; and as
<i>gwys</i> or <i>guis</i> in Old Cornish, while in Irish it was
<i>feis</i>. Nevertheless, the editor of the Twrch Trwyth story did not
know it; but it would be in no way surprising that a Welshman, who knew
his language fairly well, should be baffled by such a word in case it
was not in use in his own district in his own time. This, however,
barely touches the fringe of the question. The range of the hunt, as
already given, was mostly within the boundaries, so to say, of the
portion of South Wales where we find Goidelic inscriptions in the Ogam
character of the fifth or sixth century; and I am persuaded that the
Goidelic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528" href="#pb528" name=
"pb528">528</a>]</span>language must have lived down to the sixth or
seventh century in the south and in the north of Wales<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5087src" href="#xd26e5087" name=
"xd26e5087src">44</a>, a tract of Mid-Wales being then, probably, the
only district which can be assumed to have been completely Brythonic in
point of speech. In this very story, probably, such a name as Garth
Grugyn is but slightly modified from a Goidelic <i>Gort Grucaind</i>,
&lsquo;the enclosure of Grucand<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5096src"
href="#xd26e5096" name="xd26e5096src">45</a> or Grugan&rsquo;: compare
C&uacute;chulaind or <i>C&uacute;chulainn</i> made in Welsh into
Cocholyn. But the capital instance in the story of Twrch Trwyth as has
already been indicated is that of Amanw, which I detect also as
<i>Ammann</i> (probably to be read <i>Ammanu</i>), in the <i>Book of
&#7930;an D&acirc;v</i> (or <i lang="la">Liber Landavensis</i>), p.
199: it is there borne by a lay witness to a grant of land called Tir
Dimuner, which would appear to have been in what is now Monmouthshire.
Interpreted as standing for <i>in Banbh</i>, &lsquo;the Boar,&rsquo; it
would make a man&rsquo;s name of the same class as <i>Ibleid</i>, found
elsewhere in the same manuscript (pp. 178, 184), meaning evidently <i>i
Blei&#273;</i>, now <i>y Blai&#273;</i>, &lsquo;the Wolf.&rsquo; But
observe that the latter was Welsh and the former Goidelic, which makes
all the difference for our story. The Goidel relating the story would
say that a boar, <i>banbh</i>, was killed on the mountain or hill of
<i>in Banbh</i> or of &lsquo;the Boar&rsquo;; and his Goidelic hearer
could not fail to associate the place-name with the appellative. But a
Brython could hardly understand what the words <i>in Banbh</i> meant,
and certainly not after he had transformed them into <i>Ammanw</i>,
with the <i>nb</i> assimilated into <i>mm</i>, and the accent shifted
to the first syllable. It is needless to say that my remarks have no
meaning unless Goidelic was the original language of the tale.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=
"pb529">529</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the summary I have given of the hunt, I omitted a number of
proper names of the men who fell at the different spots where the Twrch
is represented brought to bay. I wish now to return to them with the
question, why were their names inserted in the story at all? It may be
suspected that they also, or at any rate some of them, were intended to
explain place-names; but I must confess to having had little success in
identifying traces of them in the ordnance maps. Others, however, may
fare better, who have a better acquaintance with the districts in
point, and in that hope I append them in their order in the
story:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Arthur sends to the hunt on the banks of the Nevern, in
Pembrokeshire, his men, Eli and Trachmyr, Gwarthegy&#273; son of Caw,
and Bedwyr; also <i>Tri meib Cle&#273;yv Divwlch</i>, &lsquo;three Sons
of the Gapless Sword.&rsquo; The dogs are also mentioned: Drudwyn,
Greid son of Eri&rsquo;s whelp, led by Arthur himself; Glythmyr
Ledewig&rsquo;s two dogs, led by Gwarthegy&#273; son of Caw; and
Arthur&rsquo;s dog Cava&#7931;, led by Bedwyr.</p>
<p>2. Twrch Trwyth makes for Cwm Kerwyn in the Preselly Mountains, and
turns to bay, killing the following men, who are called Arthur&rsquo;s

Rhei&#273;wn son of Eli Atver, and Iscovan Hael.</p>
<p>3. He turns to bay a second time in Cwm Kerwyn, and kills Gwydre son
of Arthur, Garselid Wy&#273;el, Glew son of Yscawt, and Iscawyn son of
Bannon or Panon.</p>
<p>4. Next day he is overtaken in the same neighbourhood, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href="#pb530" name="pb530">530</a>]</span>and
he kills Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr&rsquo;s three men, Huandaw, Gogigwr, and
Penn Pingon, many of the men of the country also, and Gwly&#273;yn
Saer, one of Arthur&rsquo;s chief architects.</p>
<p>5. Arthur overtakes the Twrch next in Peuliniauc (p. 512 above); and
the Twrch there kills Madawc son of Teithion, Gwyn son of Tringad son
of Neued, and Eiriawn Pen&#7931;oran.</p>

<p>7. The next occasion of his killing any men whose names are given,
is when he reaches &#7930;wch Ewin (p. 515), near which he killed Echel
Vor&#273;wyd-tw&#7931;, Arwyli eil Gwy&#273;awg Gwyr, and many men and
dogs besides.</p>
<p>8. Grugyn, one of the Twrch&rsquo;s offspring, goes to Garth Grugyn
in Keredigion with Eli and Trachmyr pursuing him; but what happened to
them we are not told in consequence of the omission mentioned above (p.
515) as occurring in the manuscript.</p>

<p>10. &#7930;wydawc goes to Ystrad Yw, where he is met by the Men of
&#7930;ydaw, and he kills Hirpeissawc, king of &#7930;ydaw, also
&#7930;ygatru&#273; Emys and Gwrbothu H&ecirc;n, maternal uncles to
Arthur.</p>
<p>By way of notes on these items, I would begin with the last by
asking, what is one to make of these Men of &#7930;ydaw? First of all,
one notices that their names are singular: thus <i>Hirpeissawc</i>,
&lsquo;Long-coated or Long-robed,&rsquo; is a curious name for their
king, as it sounds more like an epithet than a name itself. Then
<i>&#7930;ygatru&#273;</i> (also <i>&#7930;ysgatru&#273;</i>, which I
cannot understand, except as a scribal error) <i>Emys</i> is also
unusual: one would have rather expected <i>Emys Lygatru&#273;</i>,
&lsquo;Emys the Red-eyed.&rsquo; As it stands it looks as if it meant
the &lsquo;Red-eyed One of Emys.&rsquo; Moreover <i>Emys</i> reminds
one of the name of Emyr &#7930;ydaw, the ancestor in Welsh hagiology of
a number of Welsh saints. It looks as if the redactor of the <i>Red
Book</i> had mistaken an <i>r</i> for an <i>s</i> in copying from a
pre-Norman original. That he had to work on such a manuscript is proved
by the remaining instance, <i>Gwrbothu H&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;G. the
Ancient,&rsquo; in which we have undoubtedly a pre-Norman spelling of
<i>Gwrfo&#273;w</i>: the same redactor having failed to recognize the
name, left it without being converted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb532" href="#pb532" name="pb532">532</a>]</span>into the spelling of
his own school. In the <i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i> it will be
found variously written <i>Gurbodu</i>, <i>Guoruodu</i>, and
<i>Guruodu</i>. Then the epithet <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old or
ancient,&rsquo; reminds one of such instances as Math H&ecirc;n and
Gofynion H&ecirc;n, to be noticed a little later in this chapter. Let
us now direct the reader&rsquo;s attention for a moment to the word
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>, in order to see whether that may not suggest
something. The etymology of it is contested, so one has to infer its
meaning, as well as one can, from the way in which it is found used.
Now it is the ordinary Welsh word for Brittany or Little Britain, and
in Irish it becomes <i>Letha</i>, which is found applied not only to
Armorica but also to Latium. Conversely one could not be surprised if a
Goidel, writing Latin, rendered his own <i>Letha</i> or the Welsh
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i> by <i>Latium</i>, even when no part of Italy was
meant. Now it so happens that &#7930;ydaw occurs in Wales itself, to
wit in the name of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw, a Snowdonian lake already
mentioned, p. 475. It is thus described by Pennant, ii.
339:&mdash;&lsquo;We found, on arriving at the top, an hollow a mile in
length, filled with <i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw</i>, a fine lake, winding
beneath the rocks, and vastly indented by rocky projections, here and
there jutting into it. In it was one little island, the haunt of
black-backed gulls, which breed here, and, alarmed by such unexpected
visitants, broke the silence of this sequestered place by their deep
screams.&rsquo; But since Pennant&rsquo;s time mining
operations<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5503src" href="#xd26e5503" name=
"xd26e5503src">48</a> have been carried on close to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb533" href="#pb533" name=
"pb533">533</a>]</span>margin of this lake; and in the course of them
the level of the water is said to have been lowered to the extent of
sixteen feet, when, in the year 1856, an ancient canoe was discovered
there. According to the late Mr. E. L. Barnwell, who has described it
in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1874, pp. 150&ndash;1,
it was in the possession of Dr. Griffith Griffith of Tal y
Treu&#273;yn, near Harlech, who exhibited it at the Cambrian
Arch&aelig;ological Association&rsquo;s meeting at Machyn&#7931;eth in
1866<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5519src" href="#xd26e5519" name=
"xd26e5519src">49</a>. &lsquo;It measures,&rsquo; Mr. Barnwell says,
&lsquo;nine feet nine inches&mdash;a not uncommon length in the Scotch
early canoes,&mdash;and has been hollowed out of one piece of wood, as
is universally the case with these early boats.&rsquo; He goes on to
surmise that &lsquo;this canoe may have been used to reach the island,
for the sake of birds or eggs; or what is not impossible, the island
may have been the residence of some one who had reasons for preferring
so isolated an abode. It may, in fact, have been a kind of small
natural crannog, and, in one sense, a veritable lake-dwelling, access
to and from which was easy by means of such a canoe.&rsquo; Stokes
conjectures <i>&#7930;ydaw</i> to have meant coast-land, and Thurneysen
connects it with the Sanskrit <i>p&#7771;thiv&#299;</i> and Old Saxon
<i>folda</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5537src" href="#xd26e5537"
name="xd26e5537src">50</a>, &lsquo;earth&rsquo;: and, so far as I can
see, one is at liberty to assume a meaning that would satisfy
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>, &lsquo;Armorica,&rsquo; and the <i>&#7930;ydaw</i>
of <i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of &#7930;ydaw,&rsquo;
namely that it signified land which one had to reach by boat, so that
it was in fact applicable to a lake settlement of any kind, in other
words, that <i>&#7930;ydaw</i> on Snowdon was the name of the
lake-dwelling. So <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534"
name="pb534">534</a>]</span>I cannot help suggesting, with great
deference, that the place whence came the Men of &#7930;ydaw in the
story of the hunting of Twrch Trwyth was the settlement in Syfa&#273;on
lake (p. 73), and that the name of that stronghold, whether it was a
crannog or a stockaded islet, was also &#7930;ydaw. For the power of
that settlement over the surrounding country to have extended a few
miles around would be but natural to suppose&mdash;the distance between
the Yw and &#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on is, I am told, under three miles.
Should this guess prove well founded, we should have to scan with
renewed care the allusions in our stories to &#7930;ydaw, and not
assume that they always refer us to Brittany.</p>
<p>That the name &#7930;ydaw did on occasion refer to the region of
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on admits of indirect proof as follows:&mdash;The
church of &#7930;angorse on its banks is dedicated to a Saint Paulinus,
after whom also is called Capel Peulin, in the upper course of the
Towy, adjacent to the Cardiganshire parish of &#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi.
Moreover, tradition makes Paulinus attend a synod in 519 at
&#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi, where St. David distinguished himself by his
preaching against Pelagianism. Paulinus was then an old man, and St.
David had been one of his pupils at the <i>Ty Gwyn</i>,
&lsquo;Whitland,&rsquo; on the Taf, where Paulinus had established a
religious house<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5566src" href="#xd26e5566"
name="xd26e5566src">51</a>; and some five miles up a tributary brook of
the Taf is the church of &#7930;andysilio, where an ancient inscription
mentions a Paulinus. These two places, Whitland and &#7930;andysilio,
were probably in the cymwd of Peuliniog, which is called after a
Paulinus, and through which we have just followed the hunt of Twrch
Trwyth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb535" href="#pb535" name=
"pb535">535</a>]</span>(p. 512). Now the inscription to which I have
referred reads<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5580src" href="#xd26e5580"
name="xd26e5580src">52</a>, with ligatures:&mdash;</p>
<p class="xd26e135">CLVTORIGI<br>
FILI PAVLINI<br>
MARINILATIO</p>
<p>This probably means &lsquo;(the Monument) of Clutorix, son of
Paulinus from Latium in the Marsh&rsquo;; unless one ought rather to
treat <i>Marini</i> as an epithet to <i>Paulini</i>. In either case
<i>Latio</i> has probably to be construed &lsquo;<i>of</i> or <i>from
Latium</i>&rsquo;: compare a Roman inscription found at Bath
(H&uuml;bner&rsquo;s No. 48), which begins with <i lang="la">C.
Murrius. | C. F. Arniensis | Foro. Iuli. Modestus</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5631src" href="#xd26e5631" name="xd26e5631src">53</a>, and
makes in English, according to Mr. Haverfield, &lsquo;Gaius Murrius
Modestus, son of Gaius, of the tribe Arniensis, of the town Forum
Iulii.&rsquo; The easiest way to explain the last line as a whole is
probably to treat it as a compound with the qualifying word deriving
its meaning, not from <i>mare</i>, &lsquo;the sea,&rsquo; but from the
Late Latin <i>mara</i>, &lsquo;a marsh or bog.&rsquo; Thus
<i>Marini-Latium</i> would mean &lsquo;Marshy Latium,&rsquo; to
distinguish it from Latium in Italy, and from <i>Letha</i> or
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i> in the sense of Brittany, which was analogously
termed in Medieval Irish <i>Armuirc Letha</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5667src" href="#xd26e5667" name="xd26e5667src">54</a>, that is
the Armorica of <i>Letha</i>. This is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb536" href="#pb536" name="pb536">536</a>]</span>borne out by the name
of the church of Paulinus, which is in Welsh <i>&#7930;an y Gors</i>,
anglicized <i>&#7930;angorse</i>, &lsquo;the Church of the Marsh or
Bog,&rsquo; and that is exactly the meaning of the name given it in the
<i>Taxatio</i> of Pope Nicholas, which is that of <i>Ecclesia de
Mara</i>. In other terms, we have in the qualified <i>Latium</i> of the
inscription the Latium or Letha which came to be called in Welsh
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>. It is, in my opinion, from that settlement as their
head quarters, that the Men of &#7930;ydaw sallied forth to take part
in the hunt in Ystrad Yw, where the boar &#7930;wydog was killed.</p>
<p>The idea that the story of Twrch Trwyth was more or less
topographical is not a new one. Lady Charlotte Guest, in her
<i>Mabinogion</i>, ii. 363&ndash;5, traces the hunt through several
places called after Arthur, such as <i>Buarth Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cattle-pen,&rsquo; and <i>Bwr&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Table,&rsquo; besides others more miscellaneously
named, such as <i>Twyn y Moch</i>, &lsquo;the Swine&rsquo;s
Hill,&rsquo; near the source of the Amman, and <i>&#7930;wyn y
Moch</i>, &lsquo;the Swine&rsquo;s Grove,&rsquo; near the foot of the
same eminence. But one of the most remarkable statements in her note is
the following:&mdash;&lsquo;Another singular coincidence may be traced
between the name of a brook in this neighbourhood, called Echel, and
the Echel For&#273;wyttw&#7931; who is recorded in the tale as having
been slain at this period of the chase.&rsquo; I have been unable to
discover any clue to a brook called Echel, but one called Egel occurs
in the right place; so I take it that Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s
informants tacitly identified the name with that of Echel.
Substantially they were probably correct, as the Egel, called Ecel in
the dialect of the district, flows into the upper Clydach, which in its
turn falls into the Tawe near Pont ar Dawe. As the next pool mentioned
is &#7930;wch Tawe, I presume it was some water or other which drained
into the Tawe in this same neighbourhood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb537" href="#pb537" name="pb537">537</a>]</span>The relative
positions of &#7930;wch Ewin, the Egel, and &#7930;wch Tawe as
indicated above offer no apparent difficulty. The Goidelic name
underlying that of Echel was probably some such a one as <i>Eccel</i>
or <i>Ecell</i>; and <i>Ecell</i> occurs, for instance, in the <i>Book
of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 80<sup>b</sup>, as the name of a noble or
prince. In rendering this name into Welsh as <i>Echel</i>, due regard
was had for the etymological equivalence of Goidelic <i>cc</i> or
<i>c</i> to Welsh <i>ch</i>, but the unbroken oral tradition of a
people changing its language by degrees from Goidelic to Welsh was
subject to no such influence, especially in the matter of local names;
so the one here in question passed into Welsh as <i>Eccel</i>, liable
only to be modified into <i>Egel</i>. In any case, one may assume that
the death of the hero Echel was introduced to account for the name of
the brook Egel. Indications of something similar in the linguistic
sense occur in the part of the narrative relating the death of Grugyn,
at Garth Grugyn. This boar is pursued by two huntsmen called Eli and
Trachmyr, the name of the former of whom reminds one of Garth Eli, in
the parish of &#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi. Possibly the original story
located at Garth Eli the death of Eli, or some other incident in which
Grugyn was concerned; but the difficulty here is that the exact
position of Garth Grugyn is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Lastly, our information as to the hunting of Twrch Trwyth is not
exclusively derived from the Kulhwch, for besides an extremely obscure
poem about the Twrch in the <i>Book of Aneurin</i>, a manuscript of the
thirteenth century, we have one item given in the <i>Mirabilia</i>
associated with the <i lang="la">Historia Brittonum</i> of Nennius,
&sect; 73, and this carries us back to the eighth century. It reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><i lang="la">Est aliud mirabile in regione qu&aelig; dicitur Buelt.
Est ibi cumulus lapidum, et unus lapis superpositus super <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name=
"pb538">538</a>]</span>congestum, cum vestigio canis in eo. Quando
venatus est porcum Troit, impressit Cabal, qui erat canis Arthuri
militis, vestigium in lapide, et Arthur postea congregavit congestum
lapidum sub lapide in quo erat vestigium canis sui, et vocatur Carn
Cabal. Et veniunt homines et tollunt lapidem in manibus suis per
spacium diei et noctis, et in crastino die invenitur super congestum
suum.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Another wonder there is in the district called Bua&#7931;t:
there is there a heap of stones, and one stone is placed on the top of
the pile with the footmark of a dog in it. Cafa&#7931;, the dog of the
warrior Arthur, when chasing the pig Trwyd printed the mark of his foot
on it, and Arthur afterwards collected a heap of stones underneath the
stone in which was the footmark of his dog, and it is called
Cafa&#7931;&rsquo;s Cairn. And men come and take the stone away in
their hands for the space of a day and a night, and on the following
day the stone is found on the top of its heap<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5770src" href="#xd26e5770" name="xd26e5770src">55</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Charlotte Guest, in a note to the Kulhwch story in her
<i>Mabinogion</i>, ii. 360, appears to have been astonished to find
that <i>Carn Cava&#7931;</i>, as she writes it, was no fabulous mound
but an actual &lsquo;mountain in the district of Builth, to the south
of Rhayader Gwy, and within sight of that town.&rsquo; She went so far
as to persuade one of her friends to visit the summit, and he begins
his account of it to her with the words: &lsquo;Carn Cava&#7931;, or as
it is generally pronounced Corn Cava&#7931;, is a lofty and rugged
mountain.&rsquo; On one of the cairns on the mountain he discovered
what may have been the very stone to which the <i>Mirabilia</i> story
refers; but the sketch with which he accompanied his communication
cannot be said to be convincing, and he must have been drawing on his
imagination when he spoke of this somewhat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name="pb539">539</a>]</span>high
hill as a lofty mountain. Moreover his account of its name only goes
just far enough to be misleading: the name as pronounced in the
neighbourhood of Rhayader is <i>Corn Gafa&#7931;t</i> by Welsh-speaking
people, and <i>Corn Gavalt</i> by monoglot Englishmen. So it is
probable that at one time the pronunciation was <i>Carn
Gava&#7931;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5808src" href="#xd26e5808"
name="xd26e5808src">56</a>. But to return to the incident recorded by
Nennius, one has to remark that it does not occur in the Kulhwch; nor,
seeing the position of the hill, can it have been visited by Arthur or
his dog in the course of the Twrch Trwyth hunt as described by the
redactor of the story in its present form. This suggests the reflection
not only that the Twrch story is very old, but that it was put together
by selecting certain incidents out of an indefinite number, which,
taken all together, would probably have formed a network covering the
whole of South Wales as far north as the boundary of the portion of
Mid-Wales occupied by the Brythons before the Roman occupation. In
other words, the Goidels of this country had stories current among them
to explain the names of the places with which they were familiar; and
it is known that was the case with the Goidels of Ireland. Witness the
place-name legends known in Medieval Irish as <i>Dinds&#775;enchas</i>,
with which the old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540"
name="pb540">540</a>]</span>literature of Ireland abounds. On what
principle the narrator of the Kulhwch made his selection from the
repertoire I cannot say; but one cannot help seeing that he takes
little interest in the details, and that he shows still less insight
into the etymological <i>motif</i> of the incidents which he mentions.
However, this should be laid mainly to the charge, perhaps, of the
early medieval redactor.</p>
<p>Among the reasons which have been suggested for the latter
overlooking and effacing the play on the place-names, I have hinted
that he did not always understand them, as they sometimes involved a
language which may not have been his. This raises the question of
translation: if the story was originally in Goidelic, what was the
process by which it passed into Brythonic? Two answers suggest
themselves, and the first comes to this: if the story was in writing,
we may suppose a literary man to have sat down to translate it word for
word from Goidelic to Brythonic, or else to adapt it in a looser
fashion. In either case, one should suppose him a master of both
languages, and capable of doing justice to the play on the place-names.
But it is readily conceivable that the fact of his understanding both
languages might lead him to miscalculate what was exactly necessary to
enable a monoglot Brython to grasp his meaning clearly. Moreover, if
the translator had ideas of his own as to style, he might object on
principle to anything like an explanation of words being interpolated
in the narrative. In short, one could see several loopholes through
which a little confusion might force itself in, and prevent the
monoglot reader or hearer of the translation from correctly grasping
the story at all points as it was in the original. The other view, and
the more natural one, as I think, is that we should postulate the
interference of no special translator, but suppose the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb541" href="#pb541" name=
"pb541">541</a>]</span>story, or rather a congeries of stories, to have
been current among the natives of a certain part of South Wales, say
the Loughor Valley, at a time when their language was still Goidelic,
and that, as they gradually gave up Goidelic and adopted Brythonic,
they retained their stories and translated the narrative, while they
did not always translate the place-names occurring in that narrative.
Thus, for instance, would arise the discrepancy between <i>banw</i> and
<i>Amanw</i>, the latter of which to be Welsh should have been rendered
<i>y Banw</i>, &lsquo;the Boar.&rsquo; If this is approximately what
took place, it is easy to conceive the possibility of many points of
nicety being completely effaced in the course of such a rough process
of transformation. In one or two small matters it happens that we can
contrast the community as translator with the literary individual at
work: I allude to the word <i>Trwyth</i>. That vocable was not
translated, not metaphoned, if I may so term it, at all at the time: it
passed, when it was still <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i>, from Goidelic into
Brythonic, and continued in use without a break; for the changes
whereby <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i> has become <i>Trwyth</i> have been such as
other words have undergone in the course of ages, as already stated. On
the other hand, the literary man who knew something of the two
languages seems to have reasoned, that where a Goidelic <i>th</i>
occurred between vowels, the correct etymological equivalent in
Brythonic was <i>t</i>, subject to be mutated to <i>d</i>. So when he
took the name over he metaphoned <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i> into
<i>Tr&#275;t-i</i>, whence we have the <i>Porcus Troit</i> of Nennius,
and <i>Twrch Trwyd</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5942src" href=
"#xd26e5942" name="xd26e5942src">57</a> in Welsh poetry: these
<i>Troit</i> and <i>Trwyd</i> were the literary forms as contrasted
with the popular <i>Trwyth</i>. Now, if my surmises as to <i>Echel</i>
and <i>Egel</i> are near the truth, their history must be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href="#pb542" name=
"pb542">542</a>]</span>similar; that is to say, <i>Echel</i> would be
the literary form and <i>Ecel</i>, <i>Egel</i> the popular one
respectively of the Goidelic <i>Ecell</i>. A third parallel offers
itself in the case of the personal name <i>Arwyli</i>, borne by one of
Echel&rsquo;s companions: the <i>Arwyl</i> of that name has its
etymological equivalent in the <i>Arwystl-</i> of <i>Arwystli</i>, the
name of a district comprising the eastern slopes of Plinlimmon, and
represented now by the Deanery of Arwystli. So <i>Arwystli</i>
challenges comparison with the Irish <i>Airgialla</i> or
<i>Airg&eacute;ill</i>, anglicized <i>Oriel</i>, which denotes, roughly
speaking, the modern counties of Armagh, Louth, and Monaghan. For here
we have the same prefix <i>ar</i> placed in front of one and the same
vocable, which in Welsh is <i>gwystl</i>, &lsquo;a hostage,&rsquo; and
in Irish <i>giall</i>, of the same meaning and origin. The reader will
at once think of the same word in German as <i>geisel</i>, &lsquo;a
hostage,&rsquo; Old High German <i>g&#299;sal</i>. But the divergence
of sound between <i>Arwystl-i</i> and <i>Arwyl-i</i> arises out of the
difference of treatment of <i>sl</i> in Welsh and Irish. In the
Brythonic district of Mid-Wales we have <i>Arwystli</i> with <i>sl</i>
treated in the Brythonic way, while in <i>Arwyli</i> we have the
combination treated in the Goidelic way, the result being left standing
when the speakers of Goidelic in South Wales learnt Brythonic<a class=

<p>Careful observation may be expected to add to the number of these
instructive instances. It is, however, not to be supposed that all
double forms of the names in these stories are to be explained in
exactly the same way. Thus, for instance, corresponding to Lug,
genitive Loga, we have the two forms &#7930;eu and &#7930;ew, of which
the former alone matches the Irish. But it is to be observed that
&#7930;eu remains in some verses<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6050src"
href="#xd26e6050" name="xd26e6050src">59</a> in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href="#pb543" name=
"pb543">543</a>]</span>story of Math, whereas in the prose he appears
to be called &#7930;ew. It is not improbable that the editing which
introduced &#7930;ew dates comparatively late, and that it was done by
a man who was not familiar with the Venedotian place-names of which
&#7930;eu formed part, namely, <i>Din&#7931;eu</i> and
<i>Nant&#7931;eu</i>, now <i>Din&#7931;e</i> and <i>Nant&#7931;e</i>.
Similarly the two brothers, Gofannon and Amaethon, as they are called
in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math and in the Kulhwch story, are found also
called Gofynyon and Amathaon. The former agrees with the Irish form
Goibniu, genitive Goibnenn, whereas Gofannon does not. As to Amaethon
or Amathaon the Irish counterpart has, unfortunately, not been
identified. Gofannon and Amaethon have the appearance of being
etymologically transparent in Welsh, and they have probably been
remodelled by the hand of a literary redactor. There were also two
forms of the name of Manawy&#273;an in Welsh; for by the side of that
there was another, namely, Manawydan, liable to be shortened to
Manawyd: both occur in old Welsh poetry<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6074src" href="#xd26e6074" name="xd26e6074src">60</a>. But
<i>manawyd</i> or <i>mynawyd</i> is the Welsh word for an <i>awl</i>,
which is significant here, as the <i>Mabinogi</i> called after
Manawy&#273;an makes him become a shoemaker on two occasions, whence
the Triads style him one of the Three golden Shoemakers of the Isle of
Prydain: see the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 308.</p>
<p>What has happened in the way of linguistic change in one of our
stories, the Kulhwch, may have happened in others, say in the four
branches of the <i>Mabinogi</i>, namely, Pwy&#7931;, prince of Dyved;
Branwen, daughter of &#7930;yr; Math, son of Mathonwy; and
Manawy&#273;an, son of &#7930;yr. Some time ago I endeavoured to show
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name=
"pb544">544</a>]</span>the principal characters in the <i>Mabinogi</i>
of Math, namely, the sons and daughters of D&ocirc;n, are to be
identified as a group with the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, &lsquo;Tribes
of the Goddess Danu or Donu,&rsquo; of Irish legend. I called attention
to the identity of our Welsh D&ocirc;n with the Irish Donu, genitive
Donann, Gofynion or Gofannon with Goibniu, genitive Goibnenn, and of
&#7930;eu or &#7930;ew with Lug. Since then Professor Zimmer has gone
further, and suggested that the <i>Mabinogion</i> are of Irish origin;
but that I cannot quite admit. They are of Goidelic origin, but they do
not come from the Irish or the Goidels of Ireland: they come rather, as
I think, from this country&rsquo;s Goidels, who never migrated to the
sister island, but remained here eventually to adopt Brythonic speech.
There is no objection, however, so far as this argument is concerned,
to their being regarded as this country&rsquo;s Goidels descended
either from native Goidels or from early Goidelic invaders from
Ireland, or else partly from the one origin and partly from the other.
This last is perhaps the safest view to accept as a working hypothesis.
Now Professor Zimmer fixes on that of <i>Mathonwy</i>, among other
names, as probably the Welsh adaptation of some such an Irish name as
the genitive <i>Mathgamnai</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6124src"
href="#xd26e6124" name="xd26e6124src">61</a>, now anglicized
<i>Mahony</i>. This I am also prepared to accept in the sense that the
Welsh form is a loan from a Goidelic one current some time or other in
this country, and represented in Irish by <i>Mathgamnai</i>. The
preservation of Goidelic <i>th</i> in <i>Mathonwy</i> stamps it as
ranking with <i>Trwyth</i>, <i>Egel</i>, and <i>Arwyli</i>, as
contrasted with a form etymologically more correct, of which we seem to
have an echo in the Breton names <i>Madganoe</i> and
<i>Madgone</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6157src" href="#xd26e6157"
name="xd26e6157src">62</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href=
"#pb545" name="pb545">545</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another name which I am inclined to regard as brought in from
Goidelic is that of Gilvaethwy, son of D&ocirc;n: it would seem to
involve some such a word as the Irish <i>gilla</i>, &lsquo;a youth, an
attendant or servant,&rsquo; and some form of the Goidelic name
<i>Maughteus</i> or <i>Mochta</i>, so that the name
<i>Gilla-mochtai</i> meant the attendant of Mochta. This last vocable
appears in Irish as the name of several saints, but previously it was
probably that of some pagan god of the Goidels, and its meaning was
most likely the same as that of the Irish participial <i>mochta</i>,
which Stokes explains as &lsquo;magnified, glorified&rsquo;: see his
<i>Calendar of Oengus</i>, p. ccxiv, and compare the name
<i>Mael-mochta</i>. Adamnan, in his <i lang="la">Vita S.
Columb&aelig;</i>, writes the name <i>Maucteus</i> in the following
passage, pref. ii. p. 6:&mdash;</p>
<p><i lang="la">Nam quidam proselytus Brito, homo sanctus, sancti
Patricii episcopi discipulus, Maucteus nomine, ita de nostro
prophetizavit Patrono, sicuti nobis ab antiquis traditum expertis
compertum habetur.</i></p>
<p>This saint, who is said to have prophesied of St. Columba and died
in the year 534, is described in his Life (Aug. 19) as <i lang=
"la">ortus ex Britannia</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6203src" href=
"#xd26e6203" name="xd26e6203src">63</a>, which, coupled with
Adamnan&rsquo;s <i>Brito</i>, probably refers him to Wales; but it is
remarkable that nevertheless he bore the very un-Brythonic name of
<i>Mochta</i> or <i>Mauchta</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6217src"
href="#xd26e6217" name="xd26e6217src">64</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb546" href="#pb546" name="pb546">546</a>]</span></p>
<p>To return to the <i>Mabinogion</i>: I have long been inclined to
identify &#7930;wyd, son of Kilcoed, with the Irish Liath, son of
Celtchar, of Cualu in the present county of Wicklow. Liath, whose name
means &lsquo;grey,&rsquo; is described as the comeliest youth of noble
rank among the fairies of Erin; and the only time the Welsh &#7930;wyd,
whose name also means &lsquo;grey,&rsquo; appears in the
<i>Mabinogion</i> he is ascribed, not the comeliest figure, it is true,
or the greatest personal beauty, but the most imposing disguise of a
bishop attended by his suite: he was a great magician. The name of his
father, Kil-coet, seems to me merely an inexact popular rendering of
<i>Celtchar</i>, the name of Liath&rsquo;s father: at any rate one
fails here to detect the touch of the skilled translator or literary
redactor<span class="corr" id="xd26e6311" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6313src" href=
"#xd26e6313" name="xd26e6313src">65</a> But the <i>Mabinogi</i> of
Manawy&#273;an, in which &#7930;wyd figures, is also the one in which
Pryderi king of Dyfed&rsquo;s wife is called <i>Kicua</i> or
<i>Cigfa</i>, a name which has no claim to be regarded as Brythonic. It
occurs early, however, in the legendary history of Ireland: the <i>Four
Masters</i>, under the year <span class="sc"><abbr title=
"Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2520, mention a Ciocbha as wife of a
son of Parthalon; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb547" href=
"#pb547" name="pb547">547</a>]</span>the name seems to be related to
that of a man called <i>Cioccal</i>, <span class="sc"><abbr title=
"Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2530. Lastly, Manawy&#273;an, from whom
the <i>Mabinogi</i> takes its name, is called <i>mab &#7930;yr</i>,
&lsquo;son of &#7930;yr,&rsquo; in Welsh, and <i>Manann&aacute;n mac
Lir</i> in Irish. Similarly with his brother Br&acirc;n, and his sister
Branwen, except that she has not been identified in Irish story. But in
Irish literature the genitive <i>Lir</i>, as in <i>mac Lir</i>,
&lsquo;son of <i>Ler</i>,&rsquo; is so common, and the nominative so
rare, that <i>Lir</i> came to be treated in late Irish as the
nominative too; but a genitive of the form <i>Lir</i> suggests a
nominative-accusative <i>Ler</i>, and as a matter of fact it occurs,
for instance, in the couplet:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="ga" class="lg">

<p class="line"><i>Labraid Luath Lam ar Claideb<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">A man of many feats beyond sea,</p>
<p class="line">Labraid swift of Hand on Sword is he.</p>
</div>

<p class="first">So it seems probable that the Welsh &#7930;yr<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6453src" href="#xd26e6453" name=
"xd26e6453src">67</a> is no other word than the Goidelic genitive
<i>Lir</i>, retained in use with its pronunciation modified according
to the habits of the Welsh language; and in that case<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6506src" href="#xd26e6506" name="xd26e6506src">68</a> it forms
comprehensive evidence, that the stories about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb548" href="#pb548" name="pb548">548</a>]</span>the
&#7930;yr family in Welsh legend were Goidelic before they put on a
Brythonic garb.</p>
<p>As to the <i>Mabinogion</i> generally, one may say that they are
devoted to the fortunes chiefly of three powerful houses or groups, the
children of D&ocirc;n, the children of &#7930;yr, and
Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s family. This last is brought into contact with the
&#7930;yr group, which takes practically the position of superiority.
Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s family belonged chiefly to Dyfed; but the power and
influence of the sons of &#7930;yr had a far wider range: we find them
in Anglesey, at Harlech, in Gwales or the Isle of Grasholm off
Pembrokeshire, at Aber Henvelen somewhere south of the Severn Sea, and
in Ireland. But the expedition to Ireland under Br&acirc;n, usually
called <i>Bendigeituran</i>, &lsquo;Br&acirc;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6544src" href="#xd26e6544" name="xd26e6544src">69</a> the
Blessed,&rsquo; proved so disastrous that the &#7930;yr group, as a
whole, disappears, making way for the children of D&ocirc;n. These last
came into collision with Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s son, Pryderi, in whose
country Manawy&#273;an, son of &#7930;yr, had ended his days. Pryderi,
in consequence of Gwydion&rsquo;s deceit (pp. 69, 501, 525), makes war
on Math and the children of D&ocirc;n: he falls in it, and his army
gives hostages to Math. Thus after the disappearance of the sons of
&#7930;yr, the children of D&ocirc;n are found in power in their stead
in North Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6559src" href="#xd26e6559"
name="xd26e6559src">70</a>, and that state of things corresponds
closely enough to the relation between the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann and
the Lir family in Irish legend. There Lir and his family are reckoned
in the number <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb549" href="#pb549" name=
"pb549">549</a>]</span>of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, but within that
community Lir was so powerful that it was considered but natural that
he should resent a rival candidate being elected king in preference to
him. So the Tuatha D&eacute; took pains to conciliate Lir, as did also
their king, who gave his daughter to Lir to wife, and when she died he
gave him another of his daughters<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6568src"
href="#xd26e6568" name="xd26e6568src">71</a>; and with the treatment of
her stepchildren by that deceased wife&rsquo;s sister begins one of the
three Sorrowful Tales of Erin, known to English readers as the Fate of
the Children of Lir. But the reader should observe the relative
position: the Tuatha D&eacute; remain in power, while the children of
Lir belong to the past, which is also the sequence in the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. Possibly this is not to be considered as having any
significance, but it is to be borne in mind that the Lir-&#7930;yr
group is strikingly elemental in its patronymic Lir, &#7930;yr. The
nominative, as already stated, was <i>ler</i>, &lsquo;sea,&rsquo; and
so Cormac renders <i>mac Lir</i> by <i lang="la">filius maris</i>. How
far we may venture to consider the sea to have been personified in this
context, and how early, it is impossible to say. In any case it is
deserving of notice that one group of Goidels to this day do not say
<i>mac Lir</i>, &lsquo;son of Lir,&rsquo; <i lang="la">filium
maris</i>, but always &lsquo;son of the <i>lir</i>&rsquo;: I allude to
the Gaels of the Isle of Man, in whose language <i>Manann&aacute;n mac
Lir</i> is always <i>Mannanan mac y Lir</i>, or as they spell it,
<i>Lear</i>; that is to say &lsquo;Mannanan, son of the
<i>ler</i>.&rsquo; Manxmen have been used to consider Manannan their
eponymous hero, and first king of their island: they call him more
familiarly <i>Mannanan beg mac y Lear</i>, &lsquo;Little Mannanan, son
of the <i>ler</i>&rsquo;. This we may, though no Manxman of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href="#pb550" name=
"pb550">550</a>]</span>the present day attaches any meaning to the word
<i>lir</i> or <i>lear</i>, <span class="corr" id="xd26e6623" title=
"Source: interpret">interpreted</span> as &lsquo;Little Mannanan, son
of the Sea.&rsquo; The wanderings at large of the children of Lir
before being eclipsed by the Danann-D&ocirc;n group, remind one of the
story of the labours of Hercules, where it relates that hero&rsquo;s
adventures on his return from robbing Geryon of his cattle. Pomponius
Mela, ii. 5 (p. 50), makes Hercules on that journey fight in the
neighbourhood of Aries with two sons of Poseidon or Neptune, whom he
calls (in the accusative) Albiona and Bergyon. To us, with our more
adequate knowledge of geography, the locality and the men cannot appear
the most congruous, but there can hardly be any mistake as to the two
personal names being echoes of those of Albion and Iverion, Britain and
Ireland.</p>
<p>The whole cycle of the <i>Mabinogion</i> must have appeared strange
to the story-teller and the poet of medieval Wales, and far removed
from the world in which they lived. We have possibly a trace of this
feeling in the epithet <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old, ancient,&rsquo;
given to Math in a poem in the <i>Red Book of Hergest</i>, where we
meet with the line<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6638src" href=
"#xd26e6638" name="xd26e6638src">72</a>:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With Math the ancient, with Gofannon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Similarly in the confused list of heroes which the
story-teller <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb551" href="#pb551" name=
"pb551">551</a>]</span>of the Kulhwch (<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 108) was
able to put together, we seem to have Gofannon, Math&rsquo;s relative,
referred to under the designation of <i>Gouynyon Hen</i>,
&lsquo;Gofynion the Ancient.&rsquo; To these might be added others,
such as Gwrbothu H&ecirc;n, mentioned above, p. 531, and from another
source <i>&#7930;eu Hen</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6696src" href=
"#xd26e6696" name="xd26e6696src">73</a>, &lsquo;&#7930;ew the
Ancient.&rsquo; So strange, probably, and so obscure did some of the
contents of the stories themselves seem to the story-tellers, that they
may be now and then suspected of having effaced some of the features
which it would have interested us to find preserved. This state of
things brings back to my mind words of Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s, to which
I had the pleasure of listening more years ago than I care to remember.
He was lecturing at Oxford on Celtic literature, and observing
&lsquo;how evidently the medi&aelig;val story-teller is pillaging an
antiquity of which he does not fully possess the secret; he is like a
peasant,&rsquo; Matthew Arnold went on to say, &lsquo;building his hut
on the site of Halicarnassus or Ephesus; he builds, but what he builds
is full of materials of which he knows not the history, or knows by a
glimmering tradition merely&mdash;stones &ldquo;not of this
building,&rdquo; but of an older architecture, greater, cunninger, more
majestical. In the medi&aelig;val stories of no Latin or Teutonic
people does this strike one as in those of the Welsh.&rsquo; This
becomes intelligible only on the theory of the stories having been in
Goidelic before they put on a Welsh dress.</p>
<p>When saying that the <i>Mabinogion</i> and some of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name=
"pb552">552</a>]</span>stories contained in the Kulhwch, such as the
Hunting of Twrch Trwyth, were Goidelic before they became Brythonic, I
wish to be understood to use the word Goidelic in a qualified sense.
For till the Brythons came, the Goidels were, I take it, the ruling
race in most of the southern half of Britain, with the natives as their
subjects, except in so far as that statement has to be limited by the
fact, that we do not know how far they and the natives had been
amalgamating together. In any case, the hostile advent of another race,
the Brythons, would probably tend to hasten the process of
amalgamation. That being so, the stories which I have loosely called
Goidelic may have been largely aboriginal in point of origin, and by
that I mean native, pre-Celtic and non-Aryan. It comes to this, then:
we cannot say for certain whose creation Br&acirc;n, for instance,
should be considered to have been&mdash;that of Goidels or of non-Aryan
natives. He sat, as the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen describes him, on
the rock of Harlech, a figure too colossal for any house to contain or
any ship to carry. This would seem to challenge comparison with
Cernunnos, the squatting god of ancient Gaul, around whom the other
gods appear as mere striplings, as proved by the monumental
representations in point. In these<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6724src"
href="#xd26e6724" name="xd26e6724src">74</a> he sometimes appears
antlered like a stag; sometimes he is provided either with three normal
heads or with one head furnished with three faces; and sometimes he is
reduced to a head provided with no body, which reminds one of
Br&acirc;n, who, when he had been rid of his body in consequence of a
poisoned wound inflicted on him in his foot in the slaughter of the
Meal-bag Pavilion, was reduced to the <i>Ur&#273;awl Ben</i>,
&lsquo;Venerable or Dignified <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb553"
href="#pb553" name="pb553">553</a>]</span>Head,&rsquo; mentioned in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6739src" href=
"#xd26e6739" name="xd26e6739src">75</a>. The <i>Mabinogi</i> goes on to
relate how Br&acirc;n&rsquo;s companions began to enjoy, subject to
certain conditions, his &lsquo;Venerable Head&rsquo;s&rsquo; society,
which involved banquets of a fabulous duration and of a nature not
readily to be surpassed by those around the Holy Grail. In fact here we
have beyond all doubt one of the heathen originals of which the Grail
is a Christian version. But the multiplicity of faces or heads of the
Gaulish divinity find their analogues in a direction hitherto unnoticed
as far as I know, namely, among the Letto-Slavic peoples of the Baltic
sea-board. Thus the image of Svatovit in the island of R&uuml;gen is
said to have had four faces<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6751src" href=
"#xd26e6751" name="xd26e6751src">76</a>; and the life of Otto of
Bamberg relates<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6757src" href="#xd26e6757"
name="xd26e6757src">77</a> how that high-handed evangelist proceeded to
convert the ancient Prussians to Christianity. Among other things we
are told how he found at Stettin an idol called Triglaus, a word
referring to the three heads for which the god was remarkable. The
saint took possession of the image and hewed away the body, reserving
for himself the three heads, which are represented adhering together,
forming one piece. This he sent as a trophy to Rome, and in Rome it may
be still. Were it perchance to be found, it might be expected to show a
close resemblance to the tricephal of the Gaulish altar found at Beaune
in Burgundy.</p>
<p>Before closing this chapter a word may be permitted as to the
Goidelic element in the history of Wales: it will come again before the
reader in a later chapter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href=
"#pb554" name="pb554">554</a>]</span>but what has already been advanced
or implied concerning it may here be recapitulated as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the hereditary dislike of the Brython for
the Goidel argues their having formerly lived in close proximity to one
another: see p. 473 above.</p>
<p>The tradition that the cave treasures of the Snowdon district belong
by right to the Goidels, means that they were formerly supposed to have
hidden them away when hard pressed by the Brythons: see pp. 471&ndash;2
above.</p>
<p>The sundry instances of a pair of names for a single person or
place, one Goidelic (Brythonicized) still in use, and the other
Brythonic (suggested by the Goidelic one), literary mostly and
obsolete, go to prove that the Goidels were not expelled, but allowed
to remain to adopt Brythonic speech.</p>
<p>Evidence of the indebtedness of story-tellers in Wales to their
brethren of the same profession in Ireland is comparatively scarce; and
almost in every instance of recent research establishing a connexion
between topics or incidents in the Arthurian romances and the native
literature of Ireland, the direct contact may be assumed to have been
with the folklore and legend of the Goidelic inhabitants of Wales,
whether before or after their change of language.</p>
<p>Probably the folklore and mythology of the Goidels of Wales and of
Ireland were in the mass much the same, though in some instances they
reach us in different stages of development: thus in such a case as
that of D&ocirc;n and Danu (genitive <i>Danann</i>) the Welsh allusions
in point refer to D&ocirc;n at a conspicuously earlier stage of her
r&ocirc;le than that represented by the Irish literature touching the
Tuatha D&eacute; Danann<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6782src" href=
"#xd26e6782" name="xd26e6782src">78</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb555" href="#pb555" name="pb555">555</a>]</span></p>
<p>The common point of view from which our ancestors liked to look at
the scenery around them is well illustrated by the fondness of the
Goidel, in Wales and Ireland alike, for incidents to explain his
place-names. He required the topography&mdash;indeed he requires it
still, and hence the activity of the local etymologist&mdash;to connote
story or history: he must have something that will impart the cold
light of physical nature, river and lake, moor and mountain, a warmer
tint, a dash of the pathetic element, a touch of the human, borrowed
from the light and shade of the world of imagination and fancy in which
he lives and dreams. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb556" href="#pb556"

intended to indicate the order of the three parts of the Triad, for it
is not the same in all the series. Let me here remark in a general way
that the former fondness of the Welsh for Triads was not peculiar to
them. The Irish also must have been at one time addicted to this
grouping. Witness the Triad of Cleverest Countings, in the <i>Book of
the Dun Cow</i>, fol. 58<sup>a</sup>, and the Triad of the Blemishes of
the Women of Ulster, ib. 43<sup>b</sup>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<i>Mergaed</i> for <i>Mengwaed</i> hardly requires any explanation; and
as to <i>Breat</i> or rather <i>Vreat</i>, as it occurs in mutation, we

Identified by Professor Kuno Meyer in the <i>Transactions of the

called <i lang="cy">Sescenn Uairbe&oacute;il</i>, &lsquo;the Marsh of
Uairbh&eacute;l,&rsquo; where Uairbh&eacute;l may possibly be a
man&rsquo;s name, but more likely that of a pass or gap described as
Cold-mouth: compare the Slack or Sloc in the Isle of Man, called in
Manx &lsquo;the big Mouth of the Wind.&rsquo; The Irish name comes near

quadrupeds. <i>Gwalstawt</i>, found written also <i>gwalstot</i>, is
the Anglo-Saxon word <i>wealhst&oacute;d</i>, &lsquo;an

with that of Ferghoir, borne by the Stentor of Fionn mac

have been audible over three cantreds. Naturally one who was to parley

may in Welsh be briefly called after anybody or anything. Thus in North
Cardiganshire there is a stream called <i>Einon</i>, that is to say
&lsquo;Einion&rsquo;s river,&rsquo; and the flat land on both sides of
it is called <i>Ystrad Einon</i>, which looks as if one might translate
it Einion&rsquo;s Strath, but it means the Strath of Einion&rsquo;s
river, or of the stream called Einon, as one will at once see from the
upper course of the water being called <i>Blaen Einon</i>, which can
only mean the upper course of the Einon river. So here <i>yw</i> is in
English &lsquo;yew,&rsquo; but <i>Ystrad Yw</i> and <i>&#7930;ygad
Yw</i> have to be rendered the Strath of the Yew burn and the Eye of
the Yew burn respectively. It is moreover felt by the Welsh-speaking
people of the district that <i>yw</i> is the plural of <i>ywen</i>,
&lsquo;a single yew,&rsquo; and as there is only one yew at the source
somebody had the brilliant idea of making the name right by calling it
<i>Ywen</i>, and this has got into the maps as <i>Ewyn</i>, as though
it were the Welsh word for foam. Who began it I cannot say, but
Theophilus Jones has it in his <i>History of the County of
Brecknock</i>, published in 1809. Nevertheless the name is still
<i>Yw</i>, not <i>Ywen</i> or <i>Ewyn</i>, in the Welsh of the
district, though Lewis gives it as <i>Ywen</i> in his article on

exact information as to the Gaer, the Yw, and &#7930;ygad Yw, I am
indebted chiefly to the courtesy of Lord Glanusk, the owner of that
historic strath, and to the Rector of &#7930;ansantffread, who made a
special visit to &#7930;ygad Yw for me; also to Mr. Francis Evans, of
the Farmers&rsquo; Arms at the Bwlch, who would be glad to change the
name <i lang="cy">&#7930;ygad Yw</i> into <i lang="cy">&#7930;ygad dan
yr Ywen</i>, &lsquo;the Source beneath the Yew-tree,&rsquo; partly on
account of the position &lsquo;of the spring emanating under the but of
the yew tree,&rsquo; and partly because there is only a single yew
there. Theophilus Jones complained a century ago that the Gaer in
Ystrad Yw had not attracted the attention it deserved; and I have been
greatly disappointed to find that the Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological
Association has had nothing to say of it. At any rate, I have tried the
Index of its proceedings and found only a single mention of it. The
whole district is said to teem with antiquities, Celtic, Roman, and
Norman.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e4605src">&uarr;</a></p>

sort of question one would like to ask in that district is, whether
there is a spot there called <i>Be&#273; y Rhyswyr</i>, <i>Carn y

Arthur himself in the Life of Gruffy&#273; ab Cynan, as the equivalent
probably of the Latin <i>Arthur Miles</i> (p. 538 below): see the
<i>Myvyrian Archaiology</i>, ii. 590. Similarly the soldiers or
champions of Christ are called <i>rys&#7933;yr crist</i> in the Welsh
Life of St. David: see the <i>Elucidarium and other Tracts</i> (in the

<i>Rudvyw Rys</i> would be in Modern Welsh <i>Rhu&#273;fyw Rys</i>, and
probably means Rhu&#273;fyw the Champion or Fighter, as <i>Rhys</i> is
likely to have been synonymous with <i>rhyswr</i>. The corresponding
Irish name was <i>Russ</i> or <i>Ross</i>, genitive <i>Rossa</i>, and
it appears to come from the same origin as Irish <i>ross</i>, &lsquo;a
headland, a forest,&rsquo; Welsh <i>rhos</i>, &lsquo;moorland,
uncultivated ground.&rsquo; The original meaning was presumably
&lsquo;exposed or open and untilled land&rsquo;; and Stokes supposes
the word to stand for an early <i>(p)ro-sto-</i> with <i>sto</i> of the
same origin as Latin <i>sto</i>, &lsquo;I stand,&rsquo; and as the
English word <i>stand</i> itself. In that case <i>Ros</i>, genitive
<i>Rossa</i>, Welsh <i>Rhys</i>, would mean one who stands out to
fight, a <span class="trans" title="prostat&#275;s"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#8049;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
so to say. But not only are these words of a different declension
implying a nominative <i>Ro-stus</i>, but the Welsh one must have been
once accented <i>Ro-st&uacute;s</i> on the ending which is now lost,
otherwise there is no accounting for the change of the remaining vowel
into <i>y</i>. Other instances postulating an early Welsh accentuation
of the same kind are very probably <i>&#7931;yg</i>, &lsquo;a
fieldmouse,&rsquo; Irish <i>luch</i>, &lsquo;a mouse&rsquo;;
<i>pryd</i>, &lsquo;form,&rsquo; Irish <i>cruth</i>; <i lang=
"cy">pryf</i>, &lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e5298" title=
"Source: aworm">a worm</span>,&rsquo; Irish <i>cruim</i>; so also with

"pagenum">[<a id="pb531n" href="#pb531n" name=
"pb531n">531</a>]</span>&lsquo;a nest,&rsquo; Irish <i>nett</i>,
genitive <i>nitt</i>, derived by Stokes from <i>nizdo-</i>, which,
however, must have been oxytone, like the corresponding Sanskrit
<i>n&#299;dh&aacute;</i>. There is one very interesting compound of
<i>rhys</i>, namely the saint&rsquo;s name <i>Rhwydrys</i>, as it were
<i>R&#275;do-rostus</i> to be compared with Gaulish
<i>Epor&#275;do-r&#299;x</i>, which is found in Irish analysed into
<i>r&iacute; Eochraidhi</i>, designating the fairy king who was father
to &Eacute;t&aacute;in: see Windisch&rsquo;s <i>Irische Texte</i>, p.
119. <i>Bledrws</i>, <i>Bledrus</i>, as contrasted with <i>Bledrys</i>,
<i>Bledris</i>, postulate Goidelic accentuation, while one has to treat
<i>Bledruis</i> as a compromise between <i>Bledrws</i> and
<i>Bledris</i>, unless it be due to misreading a <i>Bledruif</i>
(<i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i>, pp. 185, 221&ndash;2, and <i>Arch.
Camb.</i> for 1875, p. 370). The Goidelic accent at an early date moved
to first syllables, hence <i>cruth</i> (with its vowel influenced by
the <i>u&#815;</i> of a stem <i>qu&#815;r&#805;t</i>) under the stress
accent, became, when unstressed, <i>cridh</i> (from a simplified stem

Gava&#7931;</i>, the mutation being ignored in the spelling, which
frequently happens in the case even of Welsh people who never fail to
mutate their consonants in speaking. Lastly, though it was a dog that

indicated by the name <i>Gi&#7931;a</i> in the Kulhwch (Oxford
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 110), in which we seem to have the later form of
the old name <i>Gildas</i>. Compare such Irish instances as
<i>Fiachna</i> and <i>Cera</i>, which seem to imply stems originally
ending in <i>-asa-s</i> (masculine) and <i>-as&#257;</i> (feminine);

article in the Rennes <i>Dinds&#775;enchas</i> is devoted to Liath: see
the <i lang="fr">Rev. Celtique</i>, xvi. 78&ndash;9. As to
<i>Celtchar</i>, genitive <i>Celtchair</i>, the name would seem to have
meant &lsquo;him who is fond of concealment.&rsquo; The <i>Mabinogi</i>
form of the Welsh name is <i lang="cy">&#7930;wyt uab kil coet</i>,
which literally meant &lsquo;&#7930;. son of (him of) the Retreat of
the Wood.&rsquo; But in the Twrch Trwyth story, under a slightly
different form of designation, we appear to have the same person as
<i lang="cy">&#7930;wydeu mab kelcoet</i> and <i lang="cy">&#7930;wydeu
mab kel coet</i>, which would seem to mean &lsquo;&#7930;. son of (him
of) the Hidden Wood.&rsquo; It looks as if the bilingual story-teller
of the language transition had not been able to give up the <i>cel</i>
of Celtchar at the same time that he rendered <i>celt</i> by
<i>coet</i>, &lsquo;wood or trees,&rsquo; as if identifying it with
<i>cailt</i>: witness the Medieval Irish <i>caill</i>, &lsquo;a wood or

has been a good deal of confusion as to the name &#7930;yr: thus for
instance, the Welsh translations of Geoffrey of Monmouth make the
<i>Leir</i> of his Latin into <i>&#7930;yr</i>, and the personage
intended is represented as the father of three daughters named
Gonerilla, Regan, and Cordeilla or Cordelia. But Cordelia is probably
the Creur&#273;ilad of the <i>Black Book</i>, p. 49<sup>b</sup>, and
the Crei&#273;ylat of the Kulhwch story (the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>,
pp. 113, 134), and her father was &#7930;&ucirc;d &#7930;awereint (=
Irish Nuada Airgetl&aacute;m) and not &#7930;yr. Then as to the
<i>Leir</i> of Geoffrey&rsquo;s Latin, that name looks as if given its
form on the strength of the <i>legr-</i> of <i>Legraceaster</i>, the
Anglo-Saxon name of the town now called Leicester, of which William of
Malmesbury (<i lang="la">Gesta Pontificum</i>, &sect; 176) says,
<i lang="la">Legrecestra est civitas antiqua in Mediterraneis Anglis, a
Legra fluvio pr&aelig;terfluente sic vocata</i>. Mr. Stevenson regards
<i>Legra</i> as an old name of the Soar, and as surviving in that of
the village of Leire, spelled <i>Legre</i> in Domesday. It seems to
point back to a <i>Legere</i> or <i>Ligere</i>, which recalls
<i>Liger</i>, &lsquo;the Loire.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

"xd26e6506" href="#xd26e6506src" name="xd26e6506">68</a></span> I say
<i>in that case</i>, as this is not quite conclusive; for Welsh has an
appellative <i>&#7931;yr</i>, &lsquo;mare, &aelig;quor,&rsquo; which
may be a generalizing of <i>&#7930;yr</i>; or else it may represent an
early <i>lerio-s</i> from <i>lero-s</i> (see p. 549 below), and our
<i>&#7930;yr</i> may possibly be this and not the Irish genitive
<i>Lir</i> retained as <i>&#7930;yr</i>. That, however, seems to me
improbable on the whole.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

is relevant to direct the reader&rsquo;s attention to Nutt&rsquo;s
<i>Legend of the Holy Grail</i>, p. 28, where, in giving an abstract of
the <i lang="fr">Petit saint Graal</i>, he speaks of the Br&acirc;n of
that romance, in French <i>Bron</i>, nominative <i>Brons</i>, as having

D&ocirc;n and &#7930;yr groups are not brought into conflict or even
placed in contact with one another; and the reason seems to be that the
story-teller wanted to introduce the sons of Beli as supreme in Britain
after the death of Br&acirc;n. Beli and his sons are also represented
in Maxen&rsquo;s Dream as ruling over Britain when the Roman conqueror
arrives. What is to be made of Beli may be learnt from <i>The Welsh

old pagan Gofannon in rather unexpected company. A few lines later in
the poem mention is made of a <i>Kaer Gofannon</i>: where was that?
Skene, in a note on it (ii. 452), says that &lsquo;In an old list of

Forth, formerly called Dumanyn.&rsquo; This is interesting only as
showing that <i>Gumanyn</i> is probably to be construed <i>Dumanyn</i>,
and that <i>Dalmeny</i> represents an ancient <i>D&uacute;n Manann</i>

<p class="first">The attitude of the Kymry towards folklore and popular
superstitions varies according to their training and religious views;
and I distinguish two classes of them in this respect. First of all,
there are those who appear to regret the ebb of the tide of ancient
beliefs. They maintain that people must have been far more interesting
when they believed in the fairies; and they rave against Sunday schools
and all other schools for having undermined the ancient superstitions
of the peasantry: it all comes, they say, of over-educating the working
classes. Of course one may occasionally wish servant maids still
believed that they might get presents from the fairies for being neat
and tidy; and that, in the contrary case of their being sluts, they
would be pinched black and blue during their sleep by the little
people: there may have been some utility in beliefs of that kind. But,
if one takes an impartial view of the surroundings in which this kind
of mental condition was possible, no sane man could say that the
superstitious beliefs of our ancestors conduced on the whole to their
happiness. Fancy a state of mind in which this sort of thing is
possible:&mdash;A member of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href=
"#pb557" name="pb557">557</a>]</span>the family is absent, let us say,
from home in the evening an hour later than usual, and the whole
household is thrown into a panic because they imagine that he has
strayed on fairy ground, and has been spirited away to the land of
fairy twilight, whence he may never return; or at any rate only to
visit his home years, or maybe ages, afterwards, and then only to fall
into a heap of dust just as he has found out that nobody expects or
even knows him. Or take another instance:&mdash;A man sets out in the
morning on an important journey, but he happens to sneeze, or he sees
an ill-omened bird, or some other dreaded creature, crossing his path:
he expects nothing that day but misfortune, and the feeling of alarm
possibly makes him turn back home, allowing the object of his journey
to be sacrificed. That was not a satisfactory state of things or a
happy one, and the unhappiness might be wholly produced by causes over
which the patient had absolutely no control, so long at any rate as the
birds of the air have wings, and so long as sneezing does not belong to
the category of voluntary actions. Then I might point to the terrors of
magic; but I take it to be unnecessary to dwell on such things, as most
people have heard about them or read of them in books. On the whole it
is but charitable to suppose that those who regret the passing away of
the ages of belief and credulity have not seriously attempted to
analyse the notions which they are pleased to cherish.</p>
<p>Now, as to the other class of people, namely, those who object to
folklore in every shape and form, they may be roughly distinguished
into different groups, such as those to whom folklore is an
abomination, because they hold that it is opposed to the Bible, and
those who regard it as too trivial to demand the attention of any
serious person. I have no occasion for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb558" href="#pb558" name="pb558">558</a>]</span>many words with the
former, since nearly everything that is harmful in popular superstition
has ceased in Wales to be a living force influencing one&rsquo;s
conduct; or if this be not already the case, it is fast becoming so.
Those therefore who condemn superstitions have really no reason to set
their faces against the student of folklore: it would be just as if
historians were to be boycotted because they have, in writing
history&mdash;frequently, the more the pity&mdash;to deal with dark
intrigues, cruel murders, and sanguinary wars. Besides, those who study
folklore do not thereby help to strengthen the hold of superstition on
the people. I have noticed that any local peculiarity of fashion, the
moment it becomes known to attract the attention of strangers, is, one
may say, doomed: a Celt, like anybody else, does not like to be
photographed in a light which may perchance show him at a disadvantage.
It is much the same, I think, with him as the subject of the studies of
the folklorist: hence the latter has to proceed with his work very
quietly and very warily. If, then, I pretended to be a folklorist,
which I can hardly claim to be, I should say that I had absolutely no
quarrel with him who condemns superstition on principle. On the other
hand, I should not consider it fair of him to regard me as opposed to
the progress of the race in happiness and civilization, just because I
am curious to understand its history.</p>
<p>With regard to him, however, who looks at the collecting and the
studying of folklore as trivial work and a waste of time, I should
gather that he regards it so on account, first perhaps, of his
forgetting the reality their superstitions were to those who believed
in them; and secondly, on account of his ignorance of their meaning. As
a reality to those who believed in them, the superstitions of our
ancestors form an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb559" href="#pb559"
name="pb559">559</a>]</span>integral part of their history. However, I
need not follow that topic further by trying to show how &lsquo;the
proper study of mankind is man,&rsquo; and how it is a mark of an
uncultured people not to know or care to know about the history of the
race. So the ancient Roman historian, Tacitus, evidently thought; for,
when complaining how little was known as to the original peopling of
Britain, he adds the suggestive words <i lang="la">ut inter
barbaros</i>, &lsquo;as usual among barbarians.&rsquo; Conversely, I
take it for granted that no liberally educated man or woman of the
present day requires to be instructed as to the value of the study of
history in all its aspects, or to be told that folklore cannot be
justly called trivial, seeing that it has to do with the history of the
race&mdash;in a wider sense, I may say with the history of the human
mind and the record of its development.</p>
<p>As history has been mentioned, it may be here pointed out that one
of the greatest of the folklorist&rsquo;s difficulties is that of
drawing the line between story and history. Nor is that the worst of
it; for the question as between fact and fiction, hard as it is in
itself, is apt to be further complicated by questions of ethnology.
This may be illustrated by reference to a group of legends which
project a vanishing distinction between the two kindred races of
Brythons and Goidels in Wales; and into the story of some of them
Arthur is introduced playing a principal r&ocirc;le. They seem to point
to a time when the Goidels had as yet wholly lost neither their own
language nor their own institutions in North Wales: for the legends
belong chiefly to Gwyne&#273;, and cluster especially around Snowdon,
where the characteristics of the Goidel as the earlier Celt may well
have lingered latest, thanks to the comparatively inaccessible nature
of the country. One of these legends has already been summarized as
representing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb560" href="#pb560" name=
"pb560">560</a>]</span>Arthur marching up the side of Snowdon towards
Bwlch y Saethau, where he falls and is buried under a cairn named from
him <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>: see p. 473. We are not told who his
enemies were; but with this question has usually been associated the
late Triad, iii. 20, which alludes to Arthur meeting in Nanhwynain with
Medrawd or Medrod (Modred) and I&#273;awc Corn Prydain, and to his
being betrayed, for the benefit and security of the Saxons in the
island. An earlier reference to the same story occurs in the Dream of
Rhonabwy in the <i>Red Book of Hergest</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6836src" href="#xd26e6836" name="xd26e6836src">1</a>, in which
I&#273;awc describes himself as I&#273;awc son of Mynio, and as
nicknamed <i>I&#273;awc Cor&#273; Prydain</i>&mdash;which means
&lsquo;I&#273;awc the Churn-staff of Prydain&rsquo;&mdash;in reference
presumably to his activity in creating dissension. He confesses to
having falsified the friendly messages of Arthur to Medrod, and to
succeeding thereby in bringing on the fatal battle of Camlan, from
which I&#273;awc himself escaped to do penance for seven years on the
<i>&#7930;ech Las</i>, &lsquo;Grey Stone<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6852src" href="#xd26e6852" name="xd26e6852src">2</a>,&rsquo; in
Prydain or Pictland.</p>
<p>Another story brings Arthur and the giant Rhita into collision, the
latter of whom has already been mentioned as having, according to local
tradition, his grave on the top of Snowdon: see pp. 474&ndash;9. The
story is a very wild one. Two kings who were brothers, Nyniaw or Nynio
and Peibiaw or Peibio, quarrelled thus: one moonlight night, as they
were together in the open air, Nynio said to Peibio, &lsquo;See, what a
fine extensive field I possess.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; asked
Peibio. &lsquo;There it is,&rsquo; said Nynio, &lsquo;the whole
firmament.&rsquo; &lsquo;See,&rsquo; said Peibio, &lsquo;what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href="#pb561" name=
"pb561">561</a>]</span>innumerable herds of cattle and sheep I have
grazing in thy field.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo; asked Nynio.
&lsquo;There they are,&rsquo; said Peibio, &lsquo;the whole host of
stars that thou seest, each of golden brightness, with the moon
shepherding them.&rsquo; &lsquo;They shall not graze in my
field,&rsquo; said Nynio. &lsquo;But they shall,&rsquo; said Peibio;
and the two kings got so enraged with one another, that they began a
war in which their warriors and subjects were nearly exterminated. Then
comes Rhita Gawr, king of Wales, and attacks them on the dangerous
ground of their being mad. He conquered them and shaved off their
beards<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6868src" href="#xd26e6868" name=
"xd26e6868src">3</a>; but when the other kings of Prydain, twenty-eight
in number, heard of it, they collected all their armies together to
avenge themselves on Rhita for the disgrace to which he had subjected
the other two. But after a great struggle Rhita conquers again, and has
the beards of the other kings shaved. Then the kings of neighbouring
kingdoms in all directions combined to make war on Rhita to avenge the
disgrace to their order; but they were also vanquished forthwith, and
treated in the same ignominious fashion as the thirty kings of Prydain.
With the beards he had a mantle made to cover him from head to foot,
and that was a good deal, we are told, since he was as big as two
ordinary men. Then Rhita turned his attention to the establishment of
just and equitable laws as between king and king and one realm with
another<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6880src" href="#xd26e6880" name=
"xd26e6880src">4</a>. But the sequel <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb562" href="#pb562" name="pb562">562</a>]</span>to the shaving is
related by Geoffrey of Monmouth, x. 3, where Arthur is made to tell how
the giant, after destroying the other kings and using their beards in
the way mentioned, asked him for his beard to fix above the other
beards, as he stood above them in rank, or else to come and fight a
duel with him. Arthur, as might be expected, chose the latter course,
with the result that he slew Rhita, there called <i>Ritho</i>, at a
place said to be <i>in Aravio Monte</i>, by which the Welsh translator
understood the chief mountain of <i>Eryri</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6903src" href="#xd26e6903" name="xd26e6903src">5</a> or Snowdon.
So it is but natural that his grave should also be there, as already
mentioned. I may here add that it is the name Snowdon itself, probably,
that underlies the <i>Senaudon</i> or <i>Sinadoun</i> of such Arthurian
romances as the English version of <i lang="la">Libeaus Desconus</i>,
though the place meant has been variously supposed to be situated
elsewhere than in the Snowdon district: witness <i>Sinodun</i> Hill in
Berkshire<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6922src" href="#xd26e6922" name=
"xd26e6922src">6</a>.</p>
<p>The story of Rhita is told also by Malory, who calls that giant
<i>Ryons</i> and <i>Ryence</i>; and there the incident seems to end
with Ryons being led to Arthur&rsquo;s court by knights who had
overcome him. Ryons&rsquo; challenge, as given by Malory<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6939src" href="#xd26e6939" name=
"xd26e6939src">7</a>, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This meane whyle came a messager from kynge Ryons of
Northwalys. And kynge he was of all Ireland and of many Iles. And this
was his message gretynge wel kynge Arthur in this manere wyse sayenge .

<p>Rhita is not said, it is true, to have been a <i>Gwy&#273;el</i>,
&lsquo;Goidel&rsquo;; but he is represented ruling over Ireland, and
his name, which is not Welsh, recalls at first sight those of such men
as <i>Boya</i> the Pict or Scot figuring in the life of St. David, and
such as <i>&#7930;ia Gvitel</i>, &lsquo;&#7930;ia the Goidel,&rsquo;
mentioned in the Stanzas of the Graves in the <i>Black Book of
Carmarthen</i> as buried in the seclusion of Ardudwy<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6963src" href="#xd26e6963" name="xd26e6963src">8</a>.
Malory&rsquo;s <i>Ryons</i> is derived from the French Romances, where,
as for example in the <i>Merlin</i>, according to the Huth MS., it
occurs as <i>Rion-s</i> in the nominative, and <i>Rion</i> in
r&eacute;gime. The latter, owing to the old French habit of eliding
<i>&#273;</i> or <i>th</i>, derives regularly enough from such a form
as the accusative <i>Rithon-em</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6997src"
href="#xd26e6997" name="xd26e6997src">9</a>, which is the one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb564" href="#pb564" name=
"pb564">564</a>]</span>occurring in Geoffrey&rsquo;s text; and we
should probably be right in concluding therefrom that the correct old
Welsh form of the name was <i>Rithon</i>. But the Goidelic form was at
the same time probably <i>Ritta</i>, with a genitive <i>Rittann</i>,
for an earlier <i>Ritton</i>. Lastly, that the local legend should
perpetuate the Goidelic <i>Ritta</i> slightly modified, has its
parallel in the case of <i>Trwyd</i> and <i>Trwyth</i>, and of
<i>Echel</i> and <i>Egel</i> or <i>Ecel</i>, pp. 541&ndash;2 and
536&ndash;7.</p>
<p>The next story<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7087src" href="#xd26e7087"
name="xd26e7087src">10</a> points to a spot between <i>y Dinas</i> or
<i>Dinas Emrys</i> and <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn y Dinas</i> as containing
the grave of <i>Owen y Mhacsen</i>, that is to say, &lsquo;Owen son of
Maxen.&rsquo; Owen had been fighting with a giant&mdash;whose name
local tradition takes for granted&mdash;with balls of steel; and there
are depressions (<i>panylau</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7108src"
href="#xd26e7108" name="xd26e7108src">11</a>) still to be seen in the
ground where each of the combatants took his stand. Some, however, will
have it that it was with bows and arrows they fought, and that the
hollows are the places they dug to defend themselves. The result was
that both died at the close of the conflict; and Owen, being asked
where he wished to be buried, ordered an arrow to be shot into the air
and his grave to be made where it fell. The story is similarly given in
the <i>Iolo MSS.</i>, pp. 81&ndash;2, where the combatants are called
<i>Owen Fin&#273;u ab Macsen Wledig</i>, &lsquo;Owen of the Dark Face,
son of Prince Maxen,&rsquo; and <i>Eurnach Hen</i>, &lsquo;E. the
Ancient,&rsquo; one of the <i>Gwy&#273;yl</i> or &lsquo;Goidels&rsquo;
of North Wales, and otherwise called <i>Urnach Wy&#273;el</i>. He is
there represented as father (1) of the Serrigi defeated by
<i>Catwa&#7931;awn</i> or <i>Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir</i>, &lsquo;C. the
Long-handed,&rsquo; at <i>Cerrig y Gwy&#273;yl</i>, &lsquo;the Stones
of the Goidels,&rsquo; near Ma&#7931;draeth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7139src" href="#xd26e7139" name="xd26e7139src">12</a>, in
Anglesey, where the great and final rout of the Goidels is represented
as having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href="#pb565" name=
"pb565">565</a>]</span>taken place<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7154src"
href="#xd26e7154" name="xd26e7154src">13</a>; (2) of Daronwy, an infant
spared and brought up in Anglesey to its detriment, as related in the
other story, p. 504; and (3) of Solor, who commands one of the three
cruising fleets of the Isle of Prydain<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7160src" href="#xd26e7160" name="xd26e7160src">14</a>. The
stronghold of Eurnach or Urnach is said to have been Dinas Ffaraon,
which was afterwards called <i>Din Emreis</i> and <i>Dinas Emrys</i>.
The whole story about the Goidels in North Wales, however, as given in
the <i>Iolo MSS.</i>, pp. 78&ndash;80, is a hopeless jumble, though it
is probably based on old traditions. In fact, one detects Eurnach or
Urnach as Wrnach or Gwrnach in the story of Kulhwch and Olwen<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7184src" href="#xd26e7184" name=
"xd26e7184src">15</a> in the <i>Red Book</i>, where we are told that
Kei or Cai, and others of Arthur&rsquo;s men, got into the
giant&rsquo;s castle and cut off his head in order to secure his sword,
which was one of the things required for the hunting of Twrch Trwyth.
In an obscure passage, also in a poem in the <i>Black Book</i>, we read
of Cai fighting in the hall of this giant, who is then called
Awarnach<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7197src" href="#xd26e7197" name=
"xd26e7197src">16</a>. Some such a feat appears to have been
commemorated in the place-name <i>Gwryd Cai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s
Feat of Arms,&rsquo; which occurs in &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s grant of
certain lands on the Be&#273;gelert and Pen Gwryd side of Snowdon in
1198 to the monks of Aberconwy, or rather in an <i lang=
"la">inspeximus</i> of the same: see Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon</i>,
v. 673<sup>a</sup>, where it stands printed <i>gwryt, kei</i>. Nor is
it unreasonable to guess that <i>Pen Gwryd</i> is only a shortening of
<i>Pen Gwryd Cai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s Feat Knoll or Terminus&rsquo;;
but compare p. 217 above. Before leaving Cai I may point out that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb566" href="#pb566" name=
"pb566">566</a>]</span>tradition seems to ascribe to him as his
residence the place called <i>Caer Gai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s
Fort,&rsquo; between Bala and &#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn. If one may treat
Cai as a historical man, one may perhaps suppose him, or some member of
his family, commemorated by the vocable <i>Burgocavi</i> on an old
stone found at Caer Gai, and said to read: <i lang="la">Ic iacit
Salvianus Burgocavi filius Cupitiani</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7239src" href="#xd26e7239" name=
"xd26e7239src">17</a>&mdash;&lsquo;Here lies Salvianus
Burgo<i>cavis</i>, son of Cupitianus.&rsquo; The reader may also be
referred back to such non-Brythonic and little known figures as
Daronwy, Cathbalug, and Brynach, together perhaps with Mengwaed, the
wolf-lord of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, pp. 504&ndash;5. It is worth while
calling attention likewise to Goidelic indications afforded by the
topography of Eryri, to wit such cases as <i>Bwlch Mwrchan</i> or
<i>Mwlchan</i>, &lsquo;Mwrchan&rsquo;s Pass,&rsquo; sometimes made into
<i>Bwlch Mwyalchen</i> or even <i>Bwlch y Fwyalchen</i>, &lsquo;the
Ousel&rsquo;s Gap,&rsquo; near &#7930;yn Gwynain; the remarkable
remains called <i>Muriau&rsquo;r Dre</i>, &lsquo;the Town
Walls&rsquo;&mdash;otherwise known as <i>Tre&rsquo;r
Gwy&#273;elod</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7278src" href="#xd26e7278"
name="xd26e7278src">18</a>, &lsquo;the Goidels&rsquo;
town&rsquo;&mdash;on the land of Gwastad Annas at the top of
Nanhwynain; and Bwlch y Gwy&#273;el, still higher towards Pen Gwryd,
may have meant the &lsquo;Goidel&rsquo;s Pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Probably a study of the topography on the spot would result in the
identification of more names similarly significant; but I will call
attention to only one of them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb567"
href="#pb567" name="pb567">567</a>]</span>namely <i>Be&#273;gelert</i>
or, as it is locally pronounced, <i>Bethgelart</i>, though the older
spellings of the name appear to be <i>Beth Kellarth</i> and <i>Beth
Kelert</i>. Those who are acquainted with the story, as told there, of
the man who rashly killed his hound might think that
<i>Be&#273;gelert</i>, &lsquo;Gelert or Kelert&rsquo;s Grave,&rsquo;
refers to the hound; but there is a complete lack of evidence to show
this widely known story to have been associated with the neighbourhood
by antiquity<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7307src" href="#xd26e7307"
name="xd26e7307src">19</a>; and the compiler of the notes and pedigrees
known as <i>Bone&#273; y Saint</i> was probably right in treating
Kelert as the name of an ancient saint: see the <i>Myvyr. Arch.</i>,
ii. 36. In any case, <i>Kelert</i> or <i>Gelert</i> with its <i>rt</i>
cannot be a genuine Welsh name: the older spellings seem to indicate
two pronunciations&mdash;a Goidelic one, <i>Kelert</i>, and a Welsh
one, <i>Kelarth</i> or <i>Ke&#7931;arth</i>, which has not survived.
The documents, however, in which the name occurs require to be
carefully examined for the readings which they supply.</p>
<p>Lastly, from the Goidels of Arfon must not be too violently severed
those of Mona, among whom we have found, pp. 504&ndash;5, the
mysterious Cathbalug, whose name, still half unexplained, reminds one
of such Irish ones as <i>Cathbuadach</i>, &lsquo;battle-victorious or
conquering in war&rsquo;; and to the same stratum belongs
<i>Daronwy</i>, p. 504, which survives as the name of a farm in the
parish of &#7930;anfachreth. The <i>Record of Carnarvon</i>, p. 59,
speaks both of a <i>Molendinum de Darronwy et Cornewe</i>, &lsquo;Mill
of Daronwy<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7355src" href="#xd26e7355" name=
"xd26e7355src">20</a> and Cornwy,&rsquo; and of <i>Vill&aelig; de
Dorronwy et <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb568" href="#pb568" name=
"pb568">568</a>]</span>Kuwghdornok</i>, &lsquo;Vills of Daronwy and of
the Cnwch Dernog,&rsquo; which has been mentioned as now pronounced
<i>Clwch Dernog</i>, p. 457: it is situated in the adjoining parish of
&#7930;an&#273;eusant. The name is given in the same <i>Record</i> as
<i>Dernok</i>, and is doubtless to be identified with the Tern&oacute;c
not very uncommon in Irish hagiology. With these names the
<i>Record</i> further associates a holding called <i>Wele Conus</i>,
and <i>Conus</i> survives in <i>Weun Gonnws</i>, the name of a field on
the farm of Bron Heulog, adjoining Clwch Dernog. That is not all, for
Connws turns out to be the Welsh pronunciation of the Goidelic name
<i>Cunagussus</i>, of which we have the Latinized genitive on the
Bodfe&#273;an menhir, some distance north-east of the railway station
of Ty Croes. It reads: <span class="sc" lang="la">CVNOGVSI HIC
IACIT</span>, &lsquo;Here lies (the body) of Cunagussus,&rsquo; and
involves a name which has regularly become in Irish <i>Conghus</i>,
while the native Welsh equivalent would be <i>Cynwst</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7435src" href="#xd26e7435" name=
"xd26e7435src">21</a>. These names, and one<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7501src" href="#xd26e7501" name="xd26e7501src">22</a> or two more
which might be added to them, suggest a very Goidelic population as
occupying, in the fifth or sixth century, the part of the island west
of a line from Amlwch to Ma&#7931;draeth.</p>
<p>Lastly, the chronological indications of the crushing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb569" href="#pb569" name="pb569">569</a>]</span>of
the power of the Goidels, and the incipient merging of that people with
the Brythons into a single nation of Kymry or
&lsquo;Compatriots,&rsquo; are worthy of a passing remark. We seem to
find the process echoed in the Triads when they mention as a favourite
at Arthur&rsquo;s Court the lord of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, named
Menwae&#273;, who has been guessed, p. 507 above, to have been a
Goidel. Then Serrigi and Daronwy are signalized as contemporaries of
Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir, who inflicted on the former, according to the
later legend, the great defeat of Cerrig y Gwy&#273;yl<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7530src" href="#xd26e7530" name=
"xd26e7530src">23</a>. The name, however, of the leader of the Goidels
arrayed against Cadwa&#7931;on may be regarded as unknown, and Serrigi
as a later name, probably of Norse origin, introduced from an account
of a tenth century struggle with invaders from the Scandinavian kingdom
of Dublin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7542src" href="#xd26e7542" name=
"xd26e7542src">24</a>. In this conqueror we have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb570" href="#pb570" name=
"pb570">570</a>]</span>probably all that can be historical of the
Caswa&#7931;on of the <i>Mabinogion</i> of Branwen and Manawy&#273;an,
that is, the Caswa&#7931;on who ousts the Goidelic family of &#7930;yr
from power in this country, and makes Pryderi of Dyfed pay homage to
him as supreme king of the island. His name has there undergone
assimilation to that of Cassivellaunos, and he is furthermore
represented as son of Beli, king of Prydain in the days of its
independence, before the advent of the legions of Rome. But as a
historical man we are to regard Caswa&#7931;on probably as
Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir, grandson of Cune&#273;a and father of Maelgwn
of Gwyne&#273;. Now Cune&#273;a and his sons, according to Nennius
(&sect; 62), expelled the Goidels with terrible slaughter; and one may
say, with the Triads, which practically contradict Nennius&rsquo;
statement as to the Goidels being expelled, that Cune&#273;a&rsquo;s
grandson continued the struggle with them. In any case there were
Goidels still there, for the <i>Book of Taliessin</i> seems to give
evidence<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7630src" href="#xd26e7630" name=
"xd26e7630src">25</a> of a persistent hostility, on the part of the
Goidelic bards of Gwyne&#273;, to Maelgwn and the more Brythonic
institutions which he may be regarded as representing. This brings the
Goidelic element down to the sixth century<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7636src" href="#xd26e7636" name="xd26e7636src">26</a>.
Maelgwn&rsquo;s death took place, according to the oldest manuscript of
the <i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i>, in the year 547, or ten years after
the Battle of Camlan&mdash;in which, as it says, Arthur and Medrod
fell. Now some of this is history and some is not: where is the line to
be drawn? In any case, the attempt to answer that question could not be
justly met with contempt or treated as trivial.</p>
<p>The other cause, to which I suggested that contempt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb571" href="#pb571" name="pb571">571</a>]</span>for
folklore was probably to be traced, together with the difficulties
springing therefrom to beset the folklorist&rsquo;s paths, is
one&rsquo;s ignorance of the meaning of many of the superstitions of
our ancestors. I do not wish this to be regarded as a charge of wilful
ignorance; for one has frankly to confess that many old superstitions
and superstitious practices are exceedingly hard to understand. So much
so, that those who have most carefully studied them cannot always agree
with one another in their interpretation. At first sight, some of the
superstitions seem so silly and absurd, that one cannot wonder that
those who have not gone deeply into the study of the human mind should
think them trivial, foolish, or absurd. It is, however, not improbable
that they are the results of early attempts to think out the mysteries
of nature; and our difficulty is that the thinking was so infantile,
comparatively speaking, that one finds it hard to put one&rsquo;s self
back into the mental condition of early man. But it should be clearly
understood that our difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of such
superstitions is no proof whatsoever that they had <i>no</i>
meaning.</p>
<p>The chief initial difficulty, however, meeting any one who would
collect folklore in Wales arises from the fact that various influences
have conspired to laugh it out of court, so to say, so that those who
are acquainted with superstitions and ancient fads become ashamed to
own it: they have the fear of ridicule weighing on their minds, and
that is a weight not easily removed. I can recall several instances:
among others I may mention a lady who up to middle age believed
implicitly in the existence of fairies, and was most anxious that her
children should not wander away from home at any time when there
happened to be a mist, lest the fairies should carry them away to their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572" name=
"pb572">572</a>]</span>home beneath a neighbouring lake. In her later
years, however, it was quite useless for a stranger to question her on
these things: fairy lore had been so laughed out of countenance in the
meantime, that at last she would not own, even to the members of her
own family, that she remembered anything about the fairies. Another
instance in point is supplied by the story of Caste&#7931;march, and by
my failure for a whole fortnight to elicit from the old blacksmith of
Aber Soch the legend of March ab Meirchion with horse&rsquo;s ears. Of
course I can readily understand the old man&rsquo;s shyness in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7656" title=
"Source: repeatin">repeating</span> the story of March. Science,
however, knows no such shyness, as it is her business to pry into
everything and to discover, if possible, the why and wherefore of all
things. In this context let me for a moment revert to the story of
March, silly as it looks:&mdash;March was lord of Caste&#7931;march in
&#7930;eyn, and he had horse&rsquo;s ears; so lest the secret should be
known, every one who shaved him was killed forthwith; and in the spot
where the bodies were buried there grew reeds, which a bard cut in
order to provide himself with a pipe. The pipe when made would give no
music but words meaning <i>March has horse&rsquo;s ears</i>! There are
other forms of the story, but all substantially the same as that
preserved for us by &#7930;wyd (pp. 233&ndash;4), except that one of
them resembles more closely the Irish version about to be summarized.
It occurs in a manuscript in the Peniarth collection, and runs
thus:&mdash;March had horse&rsquo;s ears, a fact known to nobody but
his barber, who durst not make it known for fear of losing his head.
But the barber fell ill, so that he had to call in a physician, who
said that the patient was being killed by a secret; and he ordered him
to tell it to the ground. The barber having done so became well again,
and fine reeds grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb573" href="#pb573"
name="pb573">573</a>]</span>on the spot. One day, as the time of a
great feast was drawing nigh, certain of the pipers of Maelgwn
Gwyne&#273; coming that way saw the reeds, some of which they cut and
used for their pipes. By-and-by they had to perform before King March,
when they could elicit from their pipes no strain but
&lsquo;Horse&rsquo;s ears for March ab Meirchion&rsquo; (<i lang=
"cy">klvstiav march i varch ab Meirchion</i>). Hence arose the
saying&mdash;&lsquo;That is gone on horns and pipes&rsquo; (<i lang=
"cy">vaeth hynny ar gyrn a ffibav</i>), which was as much as to say
that the secret is become more than public<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7671src" href="#xd26e7671" name="xd26e7671src">27</a>.</p>
<p>The story, it is almost needless to say, can be traced also in
Cornwall and in Brittany<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7679src" href=
"#xd26e7679" name="xd26e7679src">28</a>; and not only among the
Brythonic peoples of those countries, but among the Goidels of Ireland
likewise. The Irish story runs thus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7685src"
href="#xd26e7685" name="xd26e7685src">29</a>:&mdash;Once on a time
there was a king over Ireland whose name was Labraid Lorc, and this is
the manner of man he was&mdash;he had two horse&rsquo;s ears on him.
And every one who shaved the king used to be slain forthwith. Now the
time of shaving him drew nigh one day, when the son of a widow in the
neighbourhood was enjoined to do it. The widow went and besought the
king that her son should not be slain, and he promised her that he
would be spared if he would only keep his secret. So it came to pass;
but the secret so disagreed with the widow&rsquo;s son that he fell
ill, and nobody could divine the cause until a druid came by. He at
once discovered that the youth was ill of an uncommunicated secret, and
ordered him to go to the meeting of four roads. &lsquo;Let him,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;turn sunwise, and the first tree he meets on the right
side let him tell the secret to it, and he will be well.&rsquo; This
you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb574" href="#pb574" name=
"pb574">574</a>]</span>might think was quite safe, as it was a tree and
not his mother, his sister, or his sweetheart; but you would be quite
mistaken in thinking so. The tree to which the secret was told was a
willow; and a famous Irish harper of that day, finding he wanted a new
harp, came and cut the makings of a harp from that very tree; but when
the harp was got ready and the harper proceeded to play on it, not a
note could he elicit but &lsquo;Labraid Lorc has horse&rsquo;s
ears!&rsquo; As to the barber&rsquo;s complaint, that was by no means
unnatural: it has often been noticed how a secret disagrees with some
natures, and how uneasy and restless it makes them until they can out
with it. The same thing also, in an aggravated form, occurs now and
then to a public man who has prepared a speech in the dark recesses of
his heart, but has to leave the meeting where he intended to have it
out, without finding his opportunity. Our neighbours on the other side
of the Channel have a technical term for that sort of sufferer: they
say of him that he is <i>malade d&rsquo;un discours rentr&eacute;</i>,
or ill of a speech which has gone into the patient&rsquo;s
constitution, like the measles or the small-pox when it fails to come
out. But to come back to the domain of folklore, I need only mention
the love-lorn knights in Malory&rsquo;s <i>Morte Darthur</i>, who
details their griefs in doleful strains to solitary fountains in the
forests: it seems to have relieved them greatly, and it sometimes
reached other ears than those of the wells. Now with regard to him of
the equine ears, some one might thoughtlessly suggest, that, if it ever
became a question of improving this kind of story, one should make the
ears into those of an ass. As a matter of fact there was a Greek story
of this kind, and in that story the man with the abnormal head was
called Midas, and his ears were said to be those of an ass. The reader
will find him figuring in most collections <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb575" href="#pb575" name="pb575">575</a>]</span>of
Greek stories; so I need not pursue the matter further, except to
remark that the exact kind of brute ears was possibly a question which
different nations decided differently. At any rate Stokes mentions a
Serbian version in which the ears were those of a goat.</p>
<p>What will, however, occur to everybody to ask, is&mdash;What was the
origin of such a story? what did it mean, if it had a meaning? Various
attempts have been made to interpret this kind of story, but nobody, so
far as I know, has found a sure key to its meaning. The best guess I
can make has been suggested in a previous chapter, from which it will
be seen that the horse fits the Welsh context, so to say, best, the
goat less well, and the ass probably least of all: see pp. 433&ndash;9
above. Supposing, then, the interpretation of the story established for
certain, the question of its origin would still remain. Did it
originate among the Celts and the Greeks and other nations who relate
it? or has it simply originated among one of those peoples and spread
itself to the others? or else have they all inherited it from a common
source? If we take the supposition that it originated independently
among a variety of people in the distant past, then comes an
interesting question as to the conditions under which it arose, and the
psychological state of the human race in the distant past. On the other
supposition one is forced to ask: Did the Celts get the story from the
Greeks, or the Greeks from the Celts, or neither from either, but from
a common source? Also when and how did the variations arise? In any
case, one cannot help seeing that a story like the one I have instanced
raises a variety of profoundly difficult and interesting questions.</p>
<p>Hard as the folklorist may find it to extract tales and legends from
the people of Wales at the present day, there is one thing which he
finds far more irritating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb576" href=
"#pb576" name="pb576">576</a>]</span>than the taciturnity of the
peasant, and that is the hopeless fashion in which some of those who
have written about Welsh folklore have deigned to record the stories
which were known to them. Take as an instance the following, which
occurs in Howells&rsquo; <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, pp.
103&ndash;4:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Cardiganshire there is a lake, beneath which it is
reported that a town lies buried; and in an arid summer, when the water
is low, a wall, on which people may walk, extending across the lake is
seen, and supposed to appertain to the inundated city or town; on one
side is a gigantic rock, which appears to have been split, as there is
a very extensive opening in it, which nearly divides it in twain, and
which tradition relates was thus occasioned:&mdash;Once upon a time
there was a person of the name of Pannog, who had two oxen, so large
that their like was never known in any part of the world, and of whom
it might be said,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They ne&rsquo;er will look upon their like again.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It chanced one day that one of them (and it appears
that they were not endued with a quantum of sense proportionate to
their bulk) was grazing near a precipice opposite the rock, and whether
it was his desire to commit suicide, or to cool his body by laving in
the lake below, one knows not, but certain it is that down he plunged,
and was never seen more: his partner searching for him a short time
after, and not perceiving any signs of his approach, bellowed almost as
loud as the Father of the Gods, who when he spake &ldquo;Earth to his
centre shook&rdquo;; however, the sound of his bleating [<i>sic</i>]
split the opposite rock, which from the circumstance is called
<i>Uchain Pannog</i> (Pannog&rsquo;s Oxen). These oxen were said to be
two persons, called in Wales, Nyniaf and Phebiaf, whom God turned into
beasts for their sins.<a id="xd26e7725" name="xd26e7725"></a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb577" href="#pb577" name=
"pb577">577</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here it is clear that Mr. Howells found a portion, if not the whole,
of his story in Welsh, taken partly from the Kulhwch story, and
apparently in the old spelling; for his own acquaintance with the
language did not enable him to translate <i lang="cy">Nynnya&#7933; a
pheiba&#7933;</i> into &lsquo;Nynio and Peibio.&rsquo; The slenderness
of his knowledge of Welsh is otherwise proved throughout his book,
especially by the way in which he spells Welsh words: in fact one need
not go beyond this very story with its <i lang="cy">Uchain Pannog</i>.
But when he had ascertained that the lake was in Cardiganshire he might
have gone a little further and have told his readers which lake it was.
It is not one of the lakes which I happen to know in the north of the
county&mdash;&#7930;yn &#7930;ygad y Rheidol on Plinlimmon, or the lake
on Moel y &#7930;yn to the north of Cwm Ceulan, or either of the Iwan
Lakes which drain into the Merin (or Meri), a tributary of the Mynach,
which flows under <i>Pont ar Fynach</i>, called in English the
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge. From inquiry I cannot find either that it is any
one of the pools in the east of the county, such as those of the Teifi,
or &#7930;yn Ferwyn, not far from the gorge known as Cwm Berwyn,
mentioned in Edward Richards&rsquo; well known lines, p. 43:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">There is, it is true, a pool at a place called Maes y
&#7930;yn in the neighbourhood of Tregaron, as to which there is a
tradition that a village once occupied the place of its waters:
otherwise it shows no similarity to the lake of Howells&rsquo; story.
Then there is a group of lakes in which the river Aeron takes its rise:
they are called &#7930;yn Ei&#273;wen, &#7930;yn Fanod, and &#7930;yn
Farch. As to &#7930;yn Ei&#273;wen, I had it years ago that at one time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb578" href="#pb578" name=
"pb578">578</a>]</span>there was a story current concerning &lsquo;wild
cattle,&rsquo; which used to come out of its waters and rush back into
them when disturbed. In the middle of this piece of water, which has a
rock on one side of it, is a small island with a modern building on it;
and one would like to know whether it shows any traces of early
occupation. Then as to &#7930;yn Farch, there is a story going that
there came out of it once on a time a wonderful animal, which was shot
by a neighbouring farmer. Lastly, at &#7930;yn Fanod there are boundary
walls which go right out into the lake; and my informant thinks the
same is the case with &#7930;yn Ei&#273;wen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7758src" href="#xd26e7758" name="xd26e7758src">30</a>. One of
these walls is probably what in Howells&rsquo; youthful hands developed
itself into a causeway. The other part of his story, referring to the
lowing of the <i>Bannog Oxen</i>, comes from a well known doggerel
which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi fraith<a class="noteref"

<p class="line">Where bellowed the ox nine times,</p>
<p class="line">Till the Foela&#7931;t rock split in two.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Brefi is the name of the river from which this
&#7930;an&#273;ewi takes its distinctive name; and it is pronounced
there much the same as <i>brefu</i>, &lsquo;the act of lowing,
bellowing, or bleating.&rsquo; Now the Brefi runs down through the
Foela&#7931;t Farm, which lies between two very big rocks popularly
fancied to have been once united, and treated by Howells, somewhat
inconsistently, as the permanent forms taken by the two oxen. The story
which Howells seems to have jumbled up with that of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb579" href="#pb579" name="pb579">579</a>]</span>one
or more lake legends, is to be found given in Samuel Rush
Meyrick&rsquo;s <i>County of Cardigan</i>: see pp. 265&ndash;6, where
one reads of a wild tradition that when the church was building there
were two oxen to draw the stone required; and one of the two died in
the effort to drag the load, while the other bellowed nine times and
thereby split the hill, which before presented itself as an obstacle.
The single ox was then able to bring the load unassisted to the site of
the church. It is to this story that the doggerel already given refers;
and, curiously enough, most of the district between &#7930;an&#273;ewi
and <i>Ystrad Fflur</i>, or Strata Florida, is more or less associated
with the <i>Ychen Bannog</i>. Thus a ridge running east and west at a
distance of some three miles from Tregaron, and separating Upper and
Lower Caron from one another, bears the name of <i>Cwys yr Ychen
Bannog</i>, or the Furrow of the <i>Ychen Bannog</i>. It somewhat
resembles in appearance an ancient dyke, but it is said to be nothing
but &lsquo;a long bank of glacial till<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7814src" href="#xd26e7814" name="xd26e7814src">32</a>.&rsquo;
Moreover there used to be preserved within the church of
&#7930;an&#273;ewi a remarkable fragment of a horn commonly called
<i>Madcorn yr Ych Bannog</i>, &lsquo;the <i>mabcorn</i> or core of the
Bannog Ox&rsquo;s Horn.&rsquo; It is now in the possession of Mr. Parry
of &#7930;idiardau, near Aberystwyth; and it has been pronounced by
Prof. Boyd Dawkins to have belonged to &lsquo;the great urus (<i>Bos
Primigenius</i>), that Charlemagne hunted in the forests of Aachen, and
the monks of St. Galle ate on their feast days.&rsquo; He adds that the
condition of the horn proves it to have been derived from a peat bog or
alluvium<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7830src" href="#xd26e7830" name=
"xd26e7830src">33</a>. On the whole, it seems to me probable that the
wild legends about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb580" href=
"#pb580" name="pb580">580</a>]</span><i>Ychen Bannog</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7836src" href="#xd26e7836" name=
"xd26e7836src">34</a> in Cardiganshire have underlying them a
substratum of tradition going back to a time when the urus was not as
yet extinct in Wales. How far the urus was once treated in this country
as an emblem of divinity, it is impossible to say; but from ancient
Gaul we have such a name as <i>Urogeno-nertus</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7964src" href="#xd26e7964" name="xd26e7964src">35</a>, meaning a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb581" href="#pb581" name=
"pb581">581</a>]</span>man of the strength of an <i>Urogen</i>, that
is, of the offspring of a urus; not to mention the Gaulish <i>Tarvos
Trigaranus</i>, or the bull with three cranes on his back. With this
divine animal M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville would identify the
<i>Donnos</i> underlying such Gallo-Roman names as <i>Donnotaurus</i>,
and that of the wonderful bull called <i>Donn</i> in the principal epic
story of Ireland<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7988src" href="#xd26e7988"
name="xd26e7988src">36</a>, where we seem to trace the same element in
the river-name given by Ptolemy as <i>Mo-donnos</i>, one of the streams
of Wicklow, or else the Slaney. This would be the earliest instance
known of the prefixing of the pronoun <i>mo</i>, &lsquo;my,&rsquo; in
its reverential application, which was confined in later ages to the
names of Goidelic saints.</p>
<p>To return, however, to the folklorist&rsquo;s difficulties, the
first thing to be done is to get as ample a supply of folklore
materials as possible; and here I come to a point at which some of the
readers of these pages could probably help; for we want all our
folklore and superstitions duly recorded and rescued from the yawning
gulf of oblivion, into which they are rapidly and irretrievably
dropping year by year, as the oldest inhabitant passes away.</p>
<p>Some years ago I attempted to collect the stories still remembered
in Wales about fairies and lake dwellers; and I seem to have thrown
some amount of enthusiasm into that pursuit. At any rate, one editor of
a Welsh newspaper congratulated me on being a thorough believer in the
fairies. Unfortunately, I was not nearly so successful in recommending
myself as a believer to the old people who could have related to me the
kind of stories I wanted. Nevertheless, the best <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb582" href="#pb582" name="pb582">582</a>]</span>plan
I found was to begin by relating a story about the fairies myself: if
that method did not result in eliciting anything from the listener,
then it was time to move on to try the experiment on another subject.
Among the things which I then found was the fact, that most of the well
known lakes and tarns of Wales were once believed to have had
inhabitants of a fairy kind, who owned cattle that sometimes came
ashore and mixed with the ordinary breeds, while an occasional lake
lady became the wife of a shepherd or farmer in the neighbourhood.
There must, however, be many more of these legends lurking in out of
the way parts of Wales in connexion with the more remote mountain
tarns; and it would be well if they were collected systematically.</p>
<p>One of the most complete and best known of these lake stories is
that of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach in the Beacons of Carmarthenshire, called
in Welsh <i>Bannau Sir Gaer</i>. The story is so much more
circumstantial than all the others, that it has been placed at the
beginning of this volume. Next to it may be ranked that of the Ystrad
Dyfodwg pool, now known as &#7930;yn y Forwyn, the details of which
have only recently been unearthed for me by a friend: see pp.
27&ndash;30 above. Well, in the Fan Fach legend the lake lady marries a
young farmer from My&#273;fai, on the Carmarthenshire side of the
range; and she is to remain his wife so long as he lives without
striking her three times without cause. When that happens, she leaves
him and calls away with her all her live stock, down to the little
black calf in the process of being flayed; for he suddenly dons his
hide and hurries away after the rest of the stock into the lake. The
three blows without cause seem to belong to a category of very ancient
determinants which have been recently discussed, with his usual acumen
and command of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb583" href="#pb583" name=
"pb583">583</a>]</span>instances from other lands, by Mr. Hartland, in
the chapters on the Swan Maidens in his <i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>.
But our South Welsh story allows the three blows only a minimum of
force; and in North Wales the determinant is of a different kind,
though probably equally ancient: for there the husband must not strike
or touch the fairy wife with anything made of iron, a condition which
probably points back to the Stone Age. For arch&aelig;ologists are
agreed, that before metal, whether iron or bronze, was used in the
manufacturing of tools, stone was the universal material for all
cutting tools and weapons. But as savages are profoundly conservative
in their habits, it is argued that on ceremonial and religious
occasions knives of stone continued to be the only ones admissible long
after bronze ones had been in common use for ordinary purposes. Take
for example the text of Exodus iv. 25, where Zipporah is mentioned
circumcising her son with a flint. From instances of the kind one may
comprehend the sort of way in which iron came to be regarded as an
abomination and a horror to the fairies. The question will be found
discussed by Mr. Hartland at length in his book mentioned above: see
more especially pp. 305&ndash;9.</p>
<p>Such, to my mind, are some of the questions to which the fairies
give rise: I now wish to add another turning on the reluctance of the
fairies to disclose their names. There is one story in particular which
would serve to illustrate this admirably; but it is one which, I am
sorry to say, I have never been able to discover complete or coherent
in Wales. The substance of it should be, roughly speaking, as
follows:&mdash;A woman finds herself in great distress and is delivered
out of it by a fairy, who claims as reward the woman&rsquo;s baby. On a
certain day the baby will inevitably be taken by the fairy unless the
fairy&rsquo;s true name is discovered by the mother. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb584" href="#pb584" name=
"pb584">584</a>]</span>fairy is foiled by being in the meantime
accidentally overheard exulting, that the mother does not know that his
or her name is Rumpelstiltzchen, or whatever it may be in the version
which happens to be in question. The best known version is the German
one, where the fairy is called Rumpelstiltzchen; and it will be found
in the ordinary editions of Grimm&rsquo;s <i>M&auml;rchen</i>. The most
complete English version is the East Anglian one published by Mr.
Edward Clodd, in his recent volume entitled <i>Tom Tit Tot</i>, pp.
8&ndash;16; and previously in an article full of research headed
&lsquo;The Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin,&rsquo; in <i>Folk-Lore</i>
for 1889, pp. 138&ndash;43. It is first to be noted that in this
version the fairy&rsquo;s name is Tom Tit Tot, and that the German and
the East Anglian stories run parallel. They agree in making the fairy a
male, in which they differ from our Welsh Silly Frit and Silly go Dwt:
in what other respect the story of our Silly differed from that of
Rumpelstiltzchen and Tom Tit Tot it is, in the present incomplete state
of the Welsh one, impossible to say. Here it may be found useful to
recall the fragments of the Welsh story: (1) A fairy woman used to come
out of Corwrion Pool to spin on fine summer days, and whilst spinning
she sang or hummed to herself <i>s&igrave;li ffrit, s&igrave;li
ffrit</i>&mdash;it does not rise even to a doggerel couplet: see p. 64
above. (2) A farmer&rsquo;s wife in &#7930;eyn used to have visits from
a fairy woman who came to borrow things from her; and one day when the
goodwife had lent her a <i>troe&#7931; bach</i>, or wheel for spinning
flax, she asked the fairy to give her name, which she declined to do.
She was, however, overheard to sing to the whir of the wheel as follows
(p. 229):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai S&igrave;li go Dwt</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yw f&rsquo;enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Silly go Dwt</p>
<p class="line">Is my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This throws some light on Silly Frit, and we know
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb585" href="#pb585" name=
"pb585">585</a>]</span>where we are; but the story is inconsequent, and
far from representing the original. We cannot, however, reconstruct it
quite on the lines of Grimm&rsquo;s or Clodd&rsquo;s version. But I
happened to mention my difficulty one day to Dr. J. A. H. Murray, when
he assured me of the existence of a Scottish version in which the fairy
is a female. He learnt it when he was a child, he said, at Denholm, in
Roxburghshire; and he was afterwards charmed to read it in Robert
Chambers&rsquo; <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i> (Edinburgh, 1858),
pp. 221&ndash;5, whence Mr. Clodd has given an abstract of it in his
&lsquo;Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin.&rsquo; Among those popular rhymes
the reader will find it as related at length by Nurse Jenny in her
inimitable fashion; but the Scotch is so broad, that I think it
advisable, at the risk of some havoc to the local colouring, to
southronize it somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see that you are fond of talks about fairies, children; and
a story about a fairy and the goodwife of Kittlerumpit has just come
into my mind; but I can&rsquo;t very well tell you now whereabouts
Kittlerumpit lies. I think it is somewhere in the Debatable Ground;
anyway I shall not pretend to know more than I do, like everybody
nowadays. I wish they would remember the ballad we used to sing long
ago:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Mony ane sings the gerss, the gerss,</p>
<p class="line">And mony ane sings the corn;</p>
<p class="line">And mony ane clatters o&rsquo; bold Robin Hood,</p>
<p class="line">Ne&rsquo;er kent where he was born.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But howsoever about Kittlerumpit: the goodman was a
rambling sort of body; and he went to a fair one day, and not only
never came home again, but nevermore was heard of. Some said he
&lsquo;listed, and others that the tiresome pressgang snatched him up,
though he was furnished with a wife and a child to boot. Alas! that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb586" href="#pb586" name=
"pb586">586</a>]</span>wretched pressgang! They went about the country
like roaring lions, seeking whom they might devour. Well do I remember
how my eldest brother Sandy was all but smothered in the meal-chest,
hiding from those rascals. After they were gone, we pulled him out from
among the meal, puffing and crying, and as white as any corpse. My
mother had to pick the meal out of his mouth with the shank of a horn
spoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, when the goodman of Kittlerumpit was gone, the
goodwife was left with small means. Little resources had she, and a
baby boy at her breast. All said they were sorry for her; but nobody
helped her&mdash;which is a common case, sirs. Howsoever the goodwife
had a sow, and that was her only consolation; for the sow was soon to
farrow, and she hoped for a good litter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we all know hope is fallacious. One day the woman goes to
the sty to fill the sow&rsquo;s trough; and what does she find but the
sow lying on her back, grunting and groaning, and ready to give up the
ghost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow this was a new pang to the goodwife&rsquo;s heart; so
she sat down on the knocking-stone<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8093src"
href="#xd26e8093" name="xd26e8093src">37</a>, with her bairn on her
knee, and cried sorer than ever she did for the loss of her own
goodman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I premise that the cottage of Kittlerumpit was built on a
brae, with a large fir-wood behind it, of which you may hear more ere
we go far on. So the goodwife, when she was wiping her eyes, chances to
look down the brae; and what does she see but an old woman, almost like
a lady, coming slowly up the road. She was dressed in green, all but a
short white apron and a black velvet hood, and a steeple-crowned beaver
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb587" href="#pb587" name=
"pb587">587</a>]</span>hat on her head. She had a long walking-staff,
as long as herself, in her hand&mdash;the sort of staff that old men
and old women helped themselves with long ago; I see no such staffs
now, sirs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, when the goodwife saw the green gentlewoman near
her, she rose and made a curtsy; and &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; quoth she,
weeping, &ldquo;I am one of the most misfortunate women
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to hear pipers&rsquo; news
and fiddlers&rsquo; tales, goodwife,&rdquo; quoth the green woman.
&ldquo;I know you have lost your goodman&mdash;we had worse losses at
the Sheriff Muir<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8104src" href="#xd26e8104"
name="xd26e8104src">38</a>; and I know that your sow is unco sick. Now
what will you give me if I cure her?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e8108" title=
"Source: &ldquo;&lsquo;">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;</span>Anything your
ladyship&rsquo;s madam likes,&rdquo; quoth the witless goodwife, never
guessing whom she had to deal with.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e8113" title=
"Source: &ldquo;&lsquo;">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;</span>Let us wet thumbs
on that bargain,&rdquo; quoth the green woman; so thumbs were wetted, I
warrant you; and into the sty madam marches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She looks at the sow with a long stare, and then began to
mutter to herself what the goodwife couldn&rsquo;t well understand; but
she said it sounded like&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pitter patter,</p>
<p class="line">Holy Water.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Then she took out of her pocket a wee bottle,
with something like oil in it; and she rubs the sow with it above the
snout, behind the ears, and on the tip of the tail. &ldquo;Get up,
beast,&rdquo; quoth the green woman. No sooner said than done&mdash;up
jumps the sow with a grunt, and away to her trough for her
breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit was a joyful goodwife now, and
would have kissed the very hem of the green woman&rsquo;s gowntail; but
she wouldn&rsquo;t let her. &ldquo;I am not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb588" href="#pb588" name="pb588">588</a>]</span>so
fond of ceremonies,&rdquo; quoth she; &ldquo;but now that I have
righted your sick beast, let us end our settled bargain. You will not
find me an unreasonable, greedy body&mdash;I like ever to do a good
turn for a small reward: all I ask, and <i>will</i> have, is that baby
boy in your bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit, who now knew her customer, gave
a shrill cry like a stuck swine. The green woman was a fairy, no doubt;
so she prays, and cries, and begs, and scolds; but all wouldn&rsquo;t
do. &ldquo;You may spare your din,&rdquo; quoth the fairy,
&ldquo;screaming as if I was as deaf as a door-nail; but this
I&rsquo;ll let you know&mdash;I cannot, by <i>the law</i> we live
under, take your bairn till the third day; and not then, if you can
tell me my right name.&rdquo; So madam goes away round the pig-sty end;
and the goodwife falls down in a swoon behind the knocking-stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, the goodwife of Kittlerumpit could not sleep any
that night for crying, and all the next day the same, cuddling her
bairn till she nearly squeezed its breath out; but the second day she
thinks of taking a walk in the wood I told you of; and so with the
bairn in her arms, she sets out, and goes far in among the trees, where
was an old quarry-hole, grown over with grass, and a bonny spring well
in the middle of it. Before she came very near, she hears the whirring
of a flax wheel, and a voice singing a song; so the woman creeps
quietly among the bushes, and peeps over the brow of the quarry; and
what does she see but the green fairy tearing away at her wheel, and
singing like any precentor:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little kens our guid dame at hame,</p>
<p class="line">That Whuppity Stoorie is my name.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; thinks the woman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the mason&rsquo;s word at last; the devil give
them joy that told it!&rdquo; So she went home far lighter than she
came out, as you may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb589" href="#pb589"
name="pb589">589</a>]</span>well guess&mdash;laughing like a madcap
with the thought of cheating the old green fairy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, you must know that this goodwife was a jocose woman,
and ever merry when her heart was not very sorely overladen. So she
thinks to have some sport with the fairy; and at the appointed time she
puts the bairn behind the knocking-stone, and sits on the stone
herself. Then she pulls her cap over her left ear and twists her mouth
on the other side, as if she were weeping; and an ugly face she made,
you may be sure. She hadn&rsquo;t long to wait, for up the brae climbs
the green fairy, neither lame nor lazy; and long ere she got near the
knocking-stone she screams out&mdash;&ldquo;Goodwife of Kittlerumpit,
you know well what I come for&mdash;stand and deliver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The woman pretends to cry harder than before, and wrings her
hands, and falls on her knees, with &ldquo;Och, sweet madam mistress,
spare my only bairn, and take the wretched sow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The devil take the sow, for my part,&rdquo;
quoth the fairy; &ldquo;I come not here for swine&rsquo;s flesh.
Don&rsquo;t be contramawcious, huzzy, but give me the child
instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Ochone, dear lady mine,&rdquo; quoth the crying
goodwife; &ldquo;forgo my poor bairn, and take me myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The devil is in the daft jade,&rdquo; quoth the
fairy, looking like the far end of a fiddle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet she
is clean demented. Who in all the earthly world, with half an eye in
his head, would ever meddle with the likes of thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow this set up the woman of Kittlerumpit&rsquo;s bristle:
for though she had two blear eyes and a long red nose besides, she
thought herself as bonny as the best of them. So she springs off her
knees, sets the top of her cap straight, and with her two hands folded
before her, she makes a curtsy down to the ground, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb590" href="#pb590" name="pb590">590</a>]</span>and,
&ldquo;In troth, fair madam,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;I might have had
the wit to know that the likes of me is not fit to tie the worst
shoe-strings of the high and mighty princess, <i>Whuppity
Stoorie</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a flash of gunpowder had come out of the ground it
couldn&rsquo;t have made the fairy leap higher than she did; then down
she came again plump on her shoe-heels; and whirling round, she ran
down the brae, screeching for rage, like an owl chased by the
witches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit laughed till she was like to
split; then she takes up her bairn, and goes into her house, singing to
it all the way:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A goo and a gitty, my bonny wee tyke,</p>
<p class="line">Ye&rsquo;se noo ha&rsquo;e your four-oories;</p>
<p class="line">Sin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve gien Nick a bane to pyke,</p>
<p class="line">Wi&rsquo; his wheels and his Whuppity
Stoories.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">That is practically Chambers&rsquo; version of this
Scottish story; and as to the name of the fairy <i>Whuppity
Stoorie</i>, the first syllable should be the equivalent of English
<i>whip</i>, while <i>stoor</i> is a Scotch word for dust in motion: so
the editor asks in a note whether the name may not have originated in
the notion &lsquo;that fairies were always present in the whirls of
dust occasioned by the wind on roads and in streets<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8190src" href="#xd26e8190" name="xd26e8190src">39</a>.&rsquo;
But he adds that another version of the story calls the green woman
<i>Fittletetot</i>, which ends with the same element as the name Tom
Tit Tot and Silly go Dwt. Perhaps, however, the Welsh versions of the
story approached nearest to one from Mochdrum in Wigtownshire,
published in the British Association&rsquo;s <i>Papers of the Liverpool
Meeting</i>, 1896, p. 613. This story was contributed by the Rev.
Walter Gregor, and the name of the fairy in it is Marget Totts: in this
we have a wife, who is in great distress, because her husband used to
give her so much flax to spin by such and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb591" href="#pb591" name="pb591">591</a>]</span>such a day, that the
work was beyond human power. A fairy comes to the rescue and takes the
flax away, promising to bring it back spun by the day fixed, provided
the woman can tell the fairy&rsquo;s name. The woman&rsquo;s distress
thereupon becomes as great as before, but the fairy was overheard
saying as she span, &lsquo;Little does the guidwife ken it, my name is
Marget Totts.&rsquo; So the woman got her flax returned spun by the
day; and the fairy, Marget Totts, went up the chimney in a blaze of
fire as the result of rage and disappointment. Here one cannot help
seeing that the original, of which this is a clumsy version, must have
been somewhat as follows</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little does the guidwife wot</p>
<p class="line">That my name is Marget Tot.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To come back to Wales, we have there the names Silly
Frit and Silly go Dwt, which are those of females. The former name is
purely English&mdash;<i>Silly Frit</i>, which has been already guessed
(p. 66) to mean a silly sprite, or silly apparition, with the idea of
its being a fright of a creature to behold: compare the application
elsewhere to a fairy changeling of the terms <i>crimbil</i> (p. 263)
and <i>cyrfaglach</i> or <i>cryfaglach</i> (p. 450), which is explained
as implying a haggard urchin that has been half starved and stunted in
its growth. Leaving out of the reckoning this connotation, one might
compare the term with the Scottish habit of calling the fairies silly
wights, &lsquo;the Happy Wights.&rsquo; See J. Jamieson&rsquo;s
<i>Scottish Dictionary</i>, where s. v. <i>seily, seely</i>,
&lsquo;happy,&rsquo; he purports to quote the following lines from
&lsquo;the Legend of the Bishop of St. Androis&rsquo; in a collection
of <i>Scottish Poems of the Sixteenth Century</i> (Edinburgh, 1801),
pp. 320&ndash;1:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Similarly, he gives the fairies the name of <i>Seely
Court</i>, and cites as illustrating it the following lines from R.

189:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Into Welsh, however, the designation Silly Frit must
have come, not from Scotland, but from the Marches; and the history of
<i>S&igrave;li go Dwt</i> must be much the same. For, though construed
as Welsh, the name would mean the Silly who is <i>go Dwt</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8285src" href="#xd26e8285" name=
"xd26e8285src">40</a>, &lsquo;somewhat tidy or natty&rsquo;; but the
<i>dwt</i> (mutated from <i>twt</i>) was suggested doubtless by the
<i>tot</i> of such fairy names as Tom Tit Tot. That brings me to
another group, where the syllable is <i>trot</i> or <i>trut</i>, and
this we have in the Welsh doggerel, mentioned at p. 229, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai Trwtyn-Tratyn</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yw f&rsquo;enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Trwtyn Tratyn</p>
<p class="line">Is my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But this name Trwtyn-Tratyn sounds masculine, and not
that of a she-fairy such as Silly Frit. The feminine would have been
Trwtan-Tratan in the Carnarvonshire pronunciation, and in fact
<i>trwtan</i> is to be heard there; but more frequently a kind of
derivative <i>trwdlan</i>, meaning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb593"
href="#pb593" name="pb593">593</a>]</span>an ungainly sort of woman, a
drudge, a short-legged or deformed maid of all work. Some Teutonic
varieties of this group of stories will be found mentioned briefly in
Mr. Clodd&rsquo;s article on the &lsquo;Philosophy of
Rumpelstiltskin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8360src" href="#xd26e8360"
name="xd26e8360src">41</a>.&rsquo; Thus from the Debatable Ground on
the borders of England and Scotland there comes a story in which the
fairy woman&rsquo;s name was Habetrot; and he alludes to an Icelandic
version in which the name is Gillitrut; but for us still more interest
attaches to the name in the following rhyme<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8366src" href="#xd26e8366" name="xd26e8366src">42</a>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little does my lady wot</p>
<p class="line">That my name is Trit-a-Trot.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This has been supposed to belong to a story coming
from Ireland; but whether that may prove true or not, it is hardly to
be doubted that our Trwtyn Tratyn is practically to be identified with
Trit-a-Trot, who is also a he-fairy.</p>
<p>That is not all; for since the foregoing notes were penned, a tale
has reached me from Mr. Craigfryn Hughes about a fairy who began by
conducting himself like the brownies mentioned at pp. 287, 324&ndash;5
above. The passages here in point come from the story of which a part
was given at pp. 462&ndash;4; and they are to the following
effect:&mdash;Long ago there was in service at a Monmouthshire farm a
young woman who was merry and strong. Who she was or whence she came
nobody knew; but many believed that she belonged to the old breed of
<i>Bendith y Mamau</i>. Some time after she had come to the farm, the
rumour spread that the house was sorely troubled by a spirit. But the
girl and the elf understood one another well, and they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb594" href="#pb594" name=
"pb594">594</a>]</span>became the best of friends. So the elf proved
very useful to the maid, for he did everything for her&mdash;washing,
ironing, spinning and twisting wool; in fact they say that he was
remarkably handy at the spinning-wheel. Moreover, he expected only a
bowlful of sweet milk and wheat bread, or some flummery, for his work.
So she took care to place the bowl with his food at the bottom of the
stairs every night as she went to bed. It ought to have been mentioned
that she was never allowed to catch a sight of him; for he always did
his work in the dark. Nor did anybody know when he ate his food: she
used to leave the bowl there at night, and it would be empty by the
time when she got up in the morning, the <i>bwca</i> having cleared it.
But one night, by way of cursedness, what did she do but fill the bowl
with some of the stale urine which they used in dyeing wool and other
things about the house. But heavens! it would have been better for her
not to have done it; for when she got up next morning what should he do
but suddenly spring from some corner and seize her by the neck! He
began to beat her and kick her from one end of the house to the other,
while he shouted at the top of his voice at every kick:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Meanwhile she screamed for help, but none came for
some time; when, however, he heard the servant men getting up, he took
to his heels as hard as he could; and nothing was heard of him for some
time. But at the end of two years he was found to be at another farm in
the neighbourhood, called Hafod yr Ynys, where he at once became great
friends with the servant girl: for she fed him like a young chicken, by
giving him a little bread and milk all the time. So he worked willingly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb595" href="#pb595" name=
"pb595">595</a>]</span>and well for her in return for his favourite
food. More especially, he used to spin and wind the yarn for her; but
she wished him in time to show his face, or to tell her his name: he
would by no means do either. One evening, however, when all the men
were out, and when he was spinning hard at the wheel, she deceived him
by telling him that she was also going out. He believed her; and when
he heard the door shutting, he began to sing as he plied the
wheel:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Hi war&#273;a&rsquo;n iawn pe gwypa hi,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Taw Gwarwyn-a-throt yw&rsquo;m enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">How she would laugh, did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Gwarwyn-a-throt is my name!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; said the maid at the bottom of
the stairs; &lsquo;I know thy name now.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is it,
then?&rsquo; he asked. She replied, &lsquo;Gwarwyn-a-throt&rsquo;; and
as soon as she uttered the words he left the wheel where it was, and
off he went. He was next heard of at a farmhouse not far off, where
there happened to be a servant man named Moses, with whom he became
great friends at once. He did all his work for Moses with great ease.
He once, however, gave him a good beating for doubting his word; but
the two remained together afterwards for some years on the best
possible terms: the end of it was that Moses became a soldier. He went
away to fight against Richard Crookback, and fell on the field of
Bosworth. The bogie, after losing his friend, began to be troublesome
and difficult to live with. He would harass the oxen when they
ploughed, and draw them after him everywhere, plough and all; nor could
any one prevent them. Then, when the sun set in the evening he would
play his pranks again, and do all sorts of mischief about the house,
upstairs, and in the cowhouses. So the farmer was advised to visit a
wise man (<i>dyn cynnil</i>), and to see if he could devise some means
of getting rid of the bogie. He called on the wise man, who happened to
be living near Caerleon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb596" href=
"#pb596" name="pb596">596</a>]</span>on the Usk; and the wise man,
having waited till the moon should be full, came to the farmer&rsquo;s
house. In due time the wise man, by force of man&oelig;uvring, secured
the bogie by the very long nose which formed the principal ornament of
his face, and earned for him the name of <i>Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn</i>,
&lsquo;the Bogie of the Nose.&rsquo; Whilst secured by the nose, the
bogie had something read to him out of the wise man&rsquo;s big book;
and he was condemned by the wise man to be transported to the banks of
the Red Sea for fourteen generations, and to be conveyed thither by
&lsquo;the upper wind&rsquo; (<i>yr uwchwynt</i>). No sooner had this
been pronounced by the cunning man than there came a whirlwind which
made the whole house shake. Then came a still mightier wind, and as it
began to blow the owner of the big book drew the awl out of the
bogie&rsquo;s nose; and it is supposed that the bogie was carried away
by that wind, for he never troubled the place any more.</p>
<p>Another version of the story seems to have been current, which
represented the bogie as in no wise to blame<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8442src" href="#xd26e8442" name="xd26e8442src">43</a>: but I
attach some importance to the foregoing tale as forming a link of
connexion between the Rumpelstiltzchen group of fairies, always trying
to get hold of children; the brownie kind, ever willing to serve in
return for their simple keep; and the troublesome bogie, that used to
haunt Welsh farm houses and delight in breaking crockery and
frightening the inmates out of their wits. In fact, the brownie and the
bogie reduce themselves here into different humours of the same uncanny
being. Their appearance may be said to have differed also: the bogie
had a very long nose, while the brownie of Blednoch had only &lsquo;a
hole where a nose should <span class="corr" id="xd26e8448" title=
"Source: hae">have</span> been.&rsquo; But one of the most remarkable
points about the brownie species is that the Lincolnshire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb597" href="#pb597" name=
"pb597">597</a>]</span>specimen was a small creature, &lsquo;a weeny
bit of a fellow&rsquo;&mdash;which suggests a possible community of
origin with the banshee of the Irish, and also of the Welsh: witness
the wee little woman in the story of the Curse of Pantannas (pp.
188&ndash;9), who seems to come up out of the river. All alike may
perhaps be said to suggest various aspects of the dead ancestor or
ancestress; but Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn is not to be severed from the fairy
woman in the Pennant Valley, who undertakes some of the duties, not of
a dairymaid, as in other cases mentioned, but those of a nurse. Her
conduct on being offered a gown is exactly that of the brownie
similarly placed: see p. 109 above. But she and Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn are
unmistakably fairies who take to domestic service, and work for a time
willingly and well in return for their food, which, as in the case of
other fairies, appears to have been mostly milk.</p>
<p>After this digression I wish only to point out that the Welsh
bogie&rsquo;s name, Gwarwyn-a-throt, treated as Welsh, could only mean
<i>white-necked and</i> (or <i>with</i>) <i>a trot</i>; for <i>a
throt</i> could only mean &lsquo;and (<i>or</i> with) a trot.&rsquo; So
it is clear that <i>a throt</i> is simply the equivalent of a-Trot,
borrowed from such an English combination as Trit-a-Trot, and that it
is idle to translate Gwarwyn-a-throt. Now <i>trot</i> and <i>twt</i>
are not native Welsh words; and the same remark applies to <i>Trwtyn
Tratyn</i>, and of course to <i>S&igrave;li ffrit</i> and
<i>S&igrave;li go Dwt</i>. Hence it is natural to infer that either
these names have in the Welsh stories merely superseded older ones of
Welsh origin, or else that there was no question of name in the Welsh
stories till they had come under English influence. The former
conjecture seems the more probable of the two, unless one should rather
suppose the whole story borrowed from English sources. But it is of no
consequence here as regards the reluctance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb598" href="#pb598" name="pb598">598</a>]</span>of
fairies to disclose their names; for we have other instances to which
the reader may turn, on pp. 45, 87&ndash;8, 97 above. One of them, in
particular, is in point here: see pp. 54, 61. It attaches itself to the
Pool of Corwrion in the neighbourhood of Bangor; and it relates how a
man married a fairy on the express condition that he was neither to
know her name nor to touch her with iron, on pain of her instantly
leaving him. Of course in the lapse of years the conditions are
accidentally violated by the luckless husband, and the wife flies
instantly away into the waters of the pool: her name turned out to be
Belene.</p>
<p>Thus far of the unwillingness of the fairies to tell their names: I
must now come to the question, why that was so. Here the anthropologist
or the student of comparative folklore comes to our aid; for it is an
important part of his business to compare the superstitions of one
people with those of another; and in the case of superstitions which
have lost their meaning among us, for instance, he searches for a
parallel among other nations, where that parallel forms part of living
institutions. In this way he hopes to discover the key to his
difficulties. In the present case he finds savages who habitually look
at the name as part and parcel of the person<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8494src" href="#xd26e8494" name="xd26e8494src">44</a>. These
savages further believe that any part of the person, such as a hair off
one&rsquo;s head or the parings of one&rsquo;s nails, if they chanced
to be found by an enemy, would give that enemy magical power over their
lives, and enable him to injure them. Hence the savage tendency to
conceal one&rsquo;s name. I have here, as the reader will perceive,
crowded together several important steps in the savage logic; so I must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb599" href="#pb599" name=
"pb599">599</a>]</span>try to illustrate them, somewhat more in detail,
by reference to some of the survivals of them after the savage has long
been civilized. To return to Wales, and to illustrate the belief that
possession of a part of one&rsquo;s person, or of anything closely
identified with one&rsquo;s person, gives the possessor of it power
over that person, I need only recall the Welsh notion, that if one
wished to sell one&rsquo;s self to the devil one had merely to give him
a hair of one&rsquo;s head or the tiniest drop of one&rsquo;s blood,
then one would be for ever his for a temporary consideration. Again, if
you only had your hair cut, it must be carefully gathered and hidden
away: by no means must it be burnt, as that might prove prejudicial to
your health. Similarly, you should never throw feathers into the fire;
for that was once held, as I infer, to bring about death among
one&rsquo;s poultry: and an old relative of mine, <i>Modryb Mari</i>,
&lsquo;Aunt Mary,&rsquo; set her face against my taste for toasted
cheese. She used to tell me that if I toasted my cheese, my sheep would
waste away and die: strictly speaking, I fancy this originally meant
only the sheep from whose milk the cheese had been made. But I was not
well versed enough in the doctrines of sympathetic magic to reply, that
it did not apply to our cheese, which was not made from sheep&rsquo;s
milk. So her warning used to frighten me and check my fondness for
toasted cheese, a fondness which I had doubtless quite innocently
inherited, as anybody will see who will glance at one of the <i>Hundred
Mery Talys</i>, printed by John Rastell in the sixteenth century, as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I fynde wrytten amonge olde gestes, howe God
mayde Saynt Peter porter of heuen, and that God of hys goodnes, sone
after his passyon, suffered many men to come to the kyngdome of Heuen
with small deseruynge; at whyche tyme there was in heuen a great
companye of Welchemen, whyche with their crakynge and babelynge
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb600" href="#pb600" name=
"pb600">600</a>]</span>troubled all the other. Wherfore God sayde to
Saynte Peter that he was wery of them, and that he wolde fayne haue
them out of heuen. To whome Saynte Peter sayd: Good Lorde, I warrente
you, that shall be done. Wherfore Saynt Peter wente out of heuen gates
and cryed wyth a loud voyce <i>Cause bobe</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8513src" href="#xd26e8513" name="xd26e8513src">45</a>, that is as
moche to saye as rosted chese, whiche thynge the Welchemen herynge,
ranne out of Heuen a great pace. And when Saynt Peter sawe them all
out, he sodenly wente into Heuen, and locked the dore, and so sparred
all the Welchemen out. By this ye may se, that it is no wysdome for a
man to loue or to set his mynde to moche upon any delycate or worldely
pleasure, wherby he shall lose the celestyall and eternall
ioye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To leave the <i>Mery Talys</i> and come back to the instances
mentioned, all of them may be said to illustrate the way in which a
part, or an adjunct, answered for the whole of a person or thing. In
fact, having due regard to magic as an exact science, an exceedingly
exact science, one may say that according to the wisdom of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb601" href="#pb601" name="pb601">601</a>]</span>our
ancestors the leading axiom of that science practically amounted to
this: the part is quite equal to the whole. Now the name, as a part of
the man, was once probably identified with the breath of life or with
the soul, as we shall see later; and the latter must have been regarded
as a kind of matter; for I well remember that when a person was dying
in a house, it was the custom about Ponterwyd, in North Cardiganshire,
to open the windows. And a farmer near Ystrad Meurig, more towards the
south of the county, told me some years ago that he remembered his
mother dying when he was a boy: a neighbour&rsquo;s wife who had been
acting as nurse tried to open the window of the room, and as it would
not open she deliberately smashed a pane of it. This was doubtless
originally meant to facilitate the escape of the soul; and the same
idea has been attested for Gloucestershire, Devon, and other parts of
the country<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8548src" href="#xd26e8548" name=
"xd26e8548src">46</a>. This way of looking at the soul reminds one of
Professor Tylor&rsquo;s words when he wrote in his work on <i>Primitive
Culture</i>, i. 440: &lsquo;and he who says that his spirit goes forth
to meet a friend, can still realize in the phrase a meaning deeper than
metaphor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then if the soul was material, you may ask what its shape was; and
even this I have a story which will answer: it comes from the same
Modryb Mari who set her face against <i>caws pobi</i>, and cherished a
good many superstitions. Therein she differed greatly from her sister,
my mother, who had a far more logical mind and a clearer conception of
things. Well, my aunt&rsquo;s story was to the following
effect:&mdash;A party of reapers on a farm not far from
Ponterwyd&mdash;I have forgotten the name&mdash;sat down in the field
to their midday meal. Afterwards they rested awhile, when one of their
number fell fast asleep. The others got up and began <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb602" href="#pb602" name=
"pb602">602</a>]</span>reaping again, glancing every now and then at
the sleeping man, who had his mouth wide open and breathed very loudly.
Presently they saw a little black man, or something like a monkey,
coming out of his mouth and starting on a walk round the field: they
watched this little fellow walking on and on till he came to a spot
near a stream. There he stopped and turned back: then he disappeared
into the open mouth of the sleeper, who at once woke up. He told his
comrades that he had just been dreaming of his walking round the field
as far as the very spot where they had seen the little black fellow
stop. I am sorry to say that Modryb Mari had wholly forgotten this
story when, years afterwards, I asked her to repeat it to me; but the
other day I found a Welshman who still remembers it. I happened to
complain, at a meeting of kindred spirits, how I had neglected making
careful notes of bits of folklore which I had heard years ago from
informants whom I had since been unable to cross-examine: I instanced
the story of the sleeping reaper, when my friend Professor Sayce at
once said that he had heard it. He spent part of his childhood near
&#7930;anover in Monmouthshire; and in those days he spoke Welsh, which
he learned from his nurse. He added that he well remembered the late
Lady &#7930;anover rebuking his father for having his child, a Welsh
boy, dressed like a little Highlander; and he remembered also hearing
the story here in question told him by his nurse. So far as he could
recall it, the version was the same as my aunt&rsquo;s, except that he
does not recollect hearing anything about the stream of water.</p>
<p>Several points in the story call for notice: among others, one
naturally asks at the outset why the other reapers did not wake the
sleeping man. The answer is that the Welsh seem to have agreed with
other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb603" href="#pb603" name=
"pb603">603</a>]</span>peoples, such as the Irish<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8568src" href="#xd26e8568" name="xd26e8568src">47</a>, in
thinking it dangerous to wake a man when dreaming, that is, when his
soul might be wandering outside his body; for it might result in the
soul failing to find the way back into the body which it had
temporarily left. To illustrate this from Wales I produce the following
story, which has been written out for me by Mr. J. G. Evans. The scene
of it was a field on the farm of Cadabowen, near &#7930;an y
By&#273;air, in the Vale of the Teifi:&mdash;&lsquo;The chief point of
the <i>madfa&#7931;</i> incident, which happened in the early sixties,
was this. During one mid-morning <i>hoe hogi</i>, that is to say, the
usual rest for sharpening the reaping-hooks, I was playing among the
thirty or forty reapers sitting together: my movements were probably a
disturbing element to the reapers, as well as a source of danger to my
own limbs. In order, therefore, to quiet me, as seems probable, one of
the men directed my attention to our old farm labourer, who was asleep
on his back close to the uncut corn, a little apart from the others. I
was told that his soul (<i>ened</i>) had gone out of his mouth in the
form of a black lizard (<i>madfa&#7931; &#273;u</i>), and was at that
moment wandering among the standing corn. If I woke the sleeper, the
soul would be unable to return; and old Thomas would die, or go crazy;
or something serious would happen. I will not trust my memory to fill
in details, especially as this incident once formed the basis of what
proved an exciting story told to my children in their childhood. A
generation hence <i>they</i> may be able to give an astonishing
instance of &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; Welsh folklore. In the meanwhile, I
can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb604" href="#pb604" name=
"pb604">604</a>]</span>bear testimony to that &ldquo;black
lizard&rdquo; being about the most living impression in my
&ldquo;memory.&rdquo; I see it, even now, wriggling at the edge of the
uncut corn. But as to its return, and the waking of the sleeper, my
memory is a blank. Such are the tricks of &ldquo;memory&rdquo;; and we
should be charitable when, with bated breath, the educated no less than
the uneducated tell us about the uncanny things they have &ldquo;seen
with their own eyes.&rdquo; They believe what they say, because they
trust their memory: I do not. I feel practically certain I never saw a
lizard in my life, in that particular field in which the reapers
were.&rsquo; Mr. Evans&rsquo; story differs, as it has been seen, from
my aunt&rsquo;s version in giving the soul the shape of a lizard; but
the little black fellow in the one and the black lizard in the other
agree not only in representing the soul as material, but also as
forming a complete organism within a larger one. In a word, both
pictures must be regarded as the outcome of attempts to depict the
sleeper&rsquo;s inner man.</p>
<p>If names and souls could be regarded as material substances, so
could diseases; and I wish to say a word or two now on that subject,
which a short story of my wife&rsquo;s will serve to introduce. She is
a native of the &#7930;anberis side of Snowdon; and she remembers going
one morning, when a small child, across to the neighbourhood of
Rhyd-&#273;u with a servant girl called Cadi, whose parents lived
there. Now Cadi was a very good servant, but she had little regard for
the more civilized manners of the &#7930;anberis folk; and when she
returned with the child in the evening from her mother&rsquo;s cottage,
she admitted that the little girl was amazed at the language of
Cadi&rsquo;s brothers and sisters; for she confessed that, as she said,
they swore like colliers, whereas the little girl had never before
heard any swearing worth speaking of. Well, among other things which
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb605" href="#pb605" name=
"pb605">605</a>]</span>little girl saw there was one of Cadi&rsquo;s
sisters having a bad leg dressed: when the rag which had been on the
wound was removed, the mother made one of her other children take it
out and fix it on the thorn growing near the door. The little girl
being inquisitive asked why that was done, and she was told that it was
in order that the wound might heal all the faster. She was not very
satisfied with the answer, but she afterwards noticed the same sort of
thing done in her own neighbourhood. Now the original idea was
doubtless that the disease, or at any rate a part of it&mdash;and in
such matters it will be remembered that a part is quite equal to the
whole&mdash;was attached to the rag; so that putting the rag out, with
a part of the disease attached to it, to rot on the bush, would bring
with it the disappearance of the whole disease.</p>
<p>Another and a wider aspect of this practice was the subject of
notice in the chapter on the Folklore of the Wells, pp. 359&ndash;60,
where Mr. Hartland&rsquo;s hypothesis was mentioned. This was to the
effect that if any clothing, or anything else which had been identified
with your person, were to be placed in contact with a sacred tree,
sacred well, or sacred edifice, it would be involved in the effluence
of the divinity that imparts its sacred character to the tree, well, or
temple; and that your person, identified with the clothing or other
article, would also be involved or soaked in the same divine effluence,
and made to benefit thereby. We have since had this kind of reasoning
illustrated, pp. 405&ndash;7 above, by the modern legend of Crymlyn,
and the old one of &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan; but the difficulty which it
involves is a very considerable one: it is the difficulty of taking
seriously the infantile order of reasoning which underlies so much of
the philosophy of folklore. I cannot readily forget one of the first
occasions of my coming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb606" href=
"#pb606" name="pb606">606</a>]</span>so to say, into living contact
with it. It was at Tuam in Connaught, whither I had gone to learn
modern Irish from the late Canon Ulick J. Bourke. There one day in 1871
he presented me with a copy of <i>The Bull &lsquo;Ineffabilis&rsquo; in
Four Languages</i> (Dublin, 1868), containing the Irish version which
he had himself contributed. On the blue cover was a gilt picture of the
Virgin, inscribed <i lang="la">Sine Labe Concepta</i>. No sooner had I
brought it to my lodgings than the woman who looked after the house
caught sight of it. She was at once struck with awe and admiration; so
I tried to explain to her the nature of the contents of the volume.
&lsquo;So the Father has given you that holy book!&rsquo; she
exclaimed; &lsquo;and you are now a holy man!&rsquo; I was astonished
at the simple and easy way in which she believed holiness could be
transferred from one person or thing to another; and it has always
helped me to realize the fact that folklorists have no occasion to
invent their people, or to exaggerate the childish features of their
minds. They are still with us as real men and real women, and at one
time the whole world belonged to them; not to mention that those who
may, by a straining of courtesy, be called their leaders of thought,
hope speedily to reannex the daring few who are trying to tear asunder
the bonds forged for mankind in the obscurity of a distant past. I
shall never forget the impression made on my mind by a sermon I heard
preached some years later in the cathedral of St. Stephen in Vienna.
That magnificent edifice in a great centre of German culture was
crowded with listeners, who seemed thoroughly to enjoy what they heard,
though the chief idea which they were asked to entertain could not
possibly be said to rise above the level of the philosophy of the Stone
Age. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb607" href="#pb607" name=

Serrigi, Serigi, or Syrigi looks like a Latin genitive torn out of its

<i>Sigtrygg-r</i>, which the Four Masters give as <i>Sitriucc</i> or
<i>Sitriug</i>: see their entries from 891 to 1091. The Scandinavians
of Dublin and its neighbourhood were addicted to descents on the shores
of North Wales; and we have possibly a trace of occupation by them in
<i>Gaue&#7931; Seirith</i>, &lsquo;Seirith&rsquo;s holding,&rsquo; in
the <i>Record of Carnarvon</i>, p. 63, where the place in question is
represented as being in the manor of Cemmaes, in Anglesey. The name
Seirith was probably that written by the Four Masters as <i>Sichfraith
Sichraidh</i> (also <i>Serridh</i>, <span class="sc">A. D.</span> 971),
that is to say the Norse <i>Sigr&aelig;&#273;-r</i> before it lost the
<i>f</i> retained in its German equivalent <i>Siegfried</i>. We seem to
detect <i>Seirith</i> later as <i>Seri</i> in place-names in
Anglesey&mdash;as for example in the name of the farms called <i>Seri
Fawr</i> and <i>Seri Bach</i> between &#7930;andrygarn and
&#7930;annerch y Me&#273;, also in a <i>Pen Seri</i>,
&lsquo;Seri&rsquo;s Knoll or Hill,&rsquo; at Bryn Du, near Ty Croes
station, and in another <i>Pen Seri</i> on Holyhead Island, between
Holyhead and &#7930;ain Goch, on the way to the South Stack. Lastly
Dugdale, v. 672<sup>b</sup> mentions a <i>Claud Seri</i>,
&lsquo;Seri&rsquo;s Dyke or Ditch,&rsquo; as being somewhere in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;anwnda, in Carnarvonshire&mdash;not very far
perhaps from the Gwyrfai and the spot where the <i>Iolo MSS.</i> (pp.
81&ndash;2) represent Serrigi repulsed by Caswa&#7931;on and driven
back to Anglesey, previous to his being crushed at Cerrig y
Gwy&#273;yl. The reader must, however, be warned that the modern
<i>Seri</i> is sometimes pronounced <i>Si&#815;eri</i> or <i>Sheri</i>,
which suggests the possibility of some of the instances involving
rather a form of the English word <i>sheriff</i>.&nbsp;<a class=

"xd26e7836" href="#xd26e7836src" name="xd26e7836">34</a></span> Several
passages bearing on the word <i>bannog</i> have been brought together
in Silvan Evans&rsquo; <i>Geiriadur</i>. He gives the meaning as
&lsquo;high, lofty, prominent, conspicuous.&rsquo; The word is derived
from <i>ban</i>, &lsquo;a summit or peak,&rsquo; plural <i>bannau</i>,
so common in the names of hills and mountains in South Wales&mdash;as
in <i>y Fan</i> in Carmarthenshire, <i>Bannwchdeni</i> (p. 22) in
Breconshire, <i>Pen y Bannau</i> near Pont Rhyd Fendigaid in
Cardiganshire, <i>Bannau Brycheiniog</i> and <i>Bannau Sir Gaer</i>,
the mountains called in English the Beacons of Breconshire and
Carmarthenshire respectively. In North Wales we have it possibly in the
compound <i>Tryfan</i>, which the mapsters will have us call
<i>Tryfaen</i>; and the corresponding word in Scotch Gaelic appears in
such names as <i>Ben Nevis</i> and the like, while in Irish the word
<i>benn</i> meant a horn or peak. I am, nevertheless, not at all sure
that <i>Ychen Bannog</i> meant horned oxen or even tall and conspicuous
oxen; for there is a Welsh word <i>man</i>, meaning a spot or mark
(Latin <i>menda</i>), and the adjective was <i>mannawc</i>,
<i>mannog</i>, &lsquo;spotted, marked, particoloured.&rsquo; Now in the
soft mutation all four words&mdash;<i>ban</i>, <i>bannog</i>, and
<i>man</i>, <i>mannog</i>&mdash;would begin with <i>f</i> = <i>v</i>,
which might help to confusion between them. This may be illustrated in
a way from Williams&rsquo; <i>Seint Greal</i> (pp. 88&ndash;92), where
Gwalchmai has a dream in which he sees 150 bulls with spots or patches
of colour on them, except three only which were &lsquo;without any spot
in the world&rsquo; (neb ryw <i>vann</i> or byt), or as it is also put
&lsquo;without spot&rsquo; (heb <i>vann</i>). This word <i>vann</i>,
applied to the colour of the bulls, comes from the radical form
<i>mann</i>; and the adjective was <i>mannawc</i> or <i>mannog</i>,
which would mean spotted, particoloured, or having patches of colour.
Now the oxen of Welsh legends are also sometimes called <i>Ychen
Mannog</i> (pp. 131&ndash;2), and it is possible, that, whichever way
the term is written, it should be interpreted to mean spotted, marked,
or particoloured oxen. I take it also that <i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi
fraith</i> was meant as synonymous with <i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi
fannog</i>, which did not fit the rhyme. Lastly, the Dyfed use of the
saying <i>Fel dau ych bannog</i>, &lsquo;Like two <i>Bannog</i>
oxen,&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;equal and inseparable
companions&rsquo; (as instanced in the <i>Geiriadur</i>), sounds like
the antithesis of the passage in the Kulhwch (<i>Mabinogion</i>, p.
121). For there we have words to the following effect: &lsquo;Though
thou shouldst get that, there is something which thou wilt not get,
namely the two oxen of Bannog, the one on the other side of the
<i>Bannog</i> mountain and the other on this side, and to bring them
together to draw the same plough. They are, to wit, Nynio and Peibio,
whom God fashioned into oxen for their sins.&rsquo; Here the difficulty
contemplated was not to separate the two, but to bring them together to
work under the same yoke. This is more in harmony with the story of the
mad quarrel between the two brother kings bearing those names as
mentioned above.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

its way into Wales from the western counties of England; and though its
meaning is more universally that of &lsquo;tidy or natty,&rsquo; the
term <i>gwas twt</i>, which in North Cardiganshire means a youth who is

earlier meaning of the French <i>tout</i>&mdash;as if <i>gwas twt</i>

Possibly, however, one may prefer to connect <i>twt</i> with the

one may venture to say that colloquial Welsh swarms with words whose

Welsh spelling is <i>caws pob</i>, &lsquo;baked (or roasted)
cheese,&rsquo; so called in parts of South Wales, such as
Carmarthenshire, whereas in North Wales it is <i>caws pobi</i>. It is
best known to Englishmen as &lsquo;Welsh rabbit,&rsquo; which superior
persons &lsquo;ruling the roast&rsquo; in our kitchens choose to make
into <i>rarebit</i>: how they would deal with &lsquo;Scotch
woodcock&rsquo; and &lsquo;Oxford hare,&rsquo; I do not know. I should
have mentioned that copies of the <i>Hundred Mery Talys</i> are
exceedingly scarce, and that the above, which is the seventy-sixth in
the collection, has here been copied from the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, iii.
115&ndash;6, where we have the following sapient
note:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Cause bobe</i>, it will be observed, is St.
Peter&rsquo;s rendering of the phrase <i lang="cy">Caws wedi ei
bobi</i>. The chief of the Apostles apparently had only a rather
imperfect knowledge of Welsh, which is not to be wondered at, as we
know that even his Hebrew was far from giving satisfaction to the
priests of the capital.&rsquo; From these words one can only say that
St. Peter would seem to have known Welsh far better than the author of
that note, and that he had acquired it from natives of South Wales,
perhaps from the neighbourhood of Kidwelly. I have to thank my friend
Mr. James Cotton for a version of the cheese story in the Bodleian
Library, namely in Malone MS. 19 (p. 144), where a certain master at

<p class="first">It will be remembered that in the last chapter a story
was given, p. 602, which represented the soul as a little fellow
somewhat resembling a monkey; and it will probably have struck the
reader how near this approaches the idea prevalent in medieval theology
and Christian art, which pictured the soul as a pigmy or diminutive
human being. I revert to this in order to point out that the Christian
fancy may possibly have given rise to the form of the soul as
represented in the Welsh story which I heard in Cardiganshire and
Professor Sayce in Monmouthshire; but this could hardly be regarded as
touching the other Cardiganshire story, in which the soul is likened to
a <i>madfa&#7931;</i> or lizard. Moreover I would point out that a
belief incompatible with both kinds of story is suggested by one of the
uses of the Welsh word for soul, namely, <i>enaid</i>. I heard my
father, a native of the neighbourhood of Eglwys Fach, near the estuary
of the Dyfi, use the word of some portion of the inside of a goose, but
I have forgotten what part it was exactly. Professor Anwyl of
Aberystwyth, however, has sent me the following communication on the
subject:&mdash;&lsquo;I am quite familiar with the expression <i>yr
enaid</i>, &ldquo;the soul,&rdquo; as applied to the soft flesh
sticking to the ribs inside a goose. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb608" href="#pb608" name="pb608">608</a>]</span>flesh in question has
somewhat the same appearance and structure as the liver. I have no
recollection of ever hearing the term <i>yr enaid</i> used in the case
of any bird other than a goose; but this may be a mere accident,
inasmuch as no one ever uses the term now except to mention it as an
interesting curiosity.&rsquo; This application of the word <i>enaid</i>
recalls the use of the English word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; in the same way,
and points to a very crude idea of the soul as material and only
forming an internal portion of the body: it is on the low level of the
notion of an English pagan of the seventeenth century who thought his
soul was &lsquo;a great bone in his body<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8645src" href="#xd26e8645" name="xd26e8645src">1</a>.&rsquo; It
is, however, not quite so foolish, perhaps, as it looks at first sight;
and it reminds one of the Mohammedan belief that the <i>os coccygis</i>
is the first formed in the human body, and that it will remain
uncorrupted till the last day as a seed from which the whole is to be
renewed in the resurrection<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8654src" href=
"#xd26e8654" name="xd26e8654src">2</a>.</p>
<p>On either savage theory, that the soul is a material organism inside
a bulkier organism, or the still lower one that it is an internal
portion of the larger organism itself, the idea of death would be
naturally much the same, namely, that it was what occurred when the
body and the soul became permanently severed. I call attention to this
because we have traces in Welsh literature of a very different notion
of death, which must now be briefly explained. The <i>Mabinogi</i> of
Math ab Mathonwy relates how Math and Gwydion made out of various
flowers a most beautiful woman whom they named Blodeuwe&#273;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8665src" href="#xd26e8665" name=
"xd26e8665src">3</a>, that is to say <span class="trans" title=
"anth&#333;d&#275;s"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7936;&nu;&theta;&#8061;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span></span>, or
flowerlike, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb609" href="#pb609" name=
"pb609">609</a>]</span>and gave to wife to &#7930;ew &#7930;awgyffes;
how she, as it were to prove what consummate artists they had been,
behaved forthwith like a woman of the ordinary origin, in that she fell
in love with another man named Gronw Pebyr of Pen&#7931;yn; and how she
plotted with Gronw as to the easiest way to put her husband to death.
Pretending to be greatly concerned about the welfare of &#7930;ew and
very anxious to take measures against his death (<i>angheu</i>), she
succeeded in finding from him in what manner one could kill
(<i>&#7931;a&#273;</i>) him. His reply was, &lsquo;Unless God kill me
&hellip; it is not easy to kill me&rsquo;; and he went on to describe
the strange attitude in which he might be killed, namely, in a certain
position when dressing after a bath: then, he said, if one cast a spear
at him it would effect his death (<i>angheu</i>), but that spear must
have been a whole year in the making, during the hour only when the
sacrifice was proceeding on Sunday. Blodeuwe&#273; thanked heaven, she
said, to find that all this was easy to avoid. But still her curiosity
was not satisfied; so one day she induced &#7930;ew to go into the bath
and show exactly what he meant. Of course she had Gronw with his
enchanted spear in readiness, and at the proper moment, when &#7930;ew
was dressing after the bath, the paramour cast his spear at him. He hit
him in the side, so that the head of the spear remained in &#7930;ew,
whilst the shaft fell off: &#7930;ew flew away in the form of an eagle,
uttering an unearthly cry. He was no more seen until Gwydion, searching
for him far and wide in Powys and Gwyne&#273;, came to Arfon, where one
day he followed the lead of a mysterious sow, until the beast stopped
under an oak at Nant&#7931;e. There Gwydion found the sow devouring
rotten flesh and maggots, which fell from an eagle whenever the bird
shook himself at the top of the tree. He suspected this was &#7930;ew,
and on singing three englyns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb610" href=
"#pb610" name="pb610">610</a>]</span>to him the eagle came lower and
lower, till at last he descended on Gwydion&rsquo;s lap. Then Gwydion
struck him with his wand, so that he assumed his own shape of &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes, and nobody ever saw a more wretched looking man, we
are told: he was nothing but skin and bones. But the best medical aid
that could be found in Gwyne&#273; was procured, and before the end of
the year he was quite well again.</p>
<p>Here it will be noticed, that though the fatal wounding of
&#7930;ew, at any rate visibly, means his being changed into the form
of an eagle, it is treated as his death. When the <i>Mabinogion</i>
were edited in their present form in a later atmosphere, this sort of
phraseology was not natural to the editor, and he shows it when he
comes to relate how Gwydion punished Blodeuwe&#273;, as
follows:&mdash;Gwydion, having overtaken her in her flight, is made to
say, &lsquo;I shall not kill thee (<i lang="cy">Ny la&#273;af i
di</i>): I shall do what is worse for thee, and that is to let thee go
in the form of a bird.&rsquo; He let her go in fact in the form of an
owl. According to the analogy of the other part of the story this meant
his having killed her: it was her death, and the words &lsquo;I shall
not kill thee&rsquo; are presumably not to be regarded as belonging to
the original story. To come back to the eagle, later Welsh literature,
re-echoing probably an ancient notion, speaks of a nephew of Arthur,
called Eliwlod, appearing to Arthur as an eagle seated likewise among
the branches of an oak. He claims acquaintance and kinship with Arthur,
but he has to explain to him that he has died: they have a
dialogue<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8698src" href="#xd26e8698" name=
"xd26e8698src">4</a> in the course of which the eagle gives Arthur some
serious Christian advice. But we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb611"
href="#pb611" name="pb611">611</a>]</span>have in this sort of idea
doubtless the kind of origin to which one might expect to trace the
prophesying eagle, such as Geoffrey mentions more than once: see his
<i lang="la">Historia</i>, ii. 9 and xii. 18<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8716src" href="#xd26e8716" name="xd26e8716src">5</a>. Add to
these instances of transformation the belief prevalent in Cornwall
almost to our own day, that Arthur himself, instead of dying, was
merely changed by magic into a raven, a form in which he still goes
about; so that a Cornishman will not wittingly fire at a raven<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8722src" href="#xd26e8722" name=
"xd26e8722src">6</a>. This sort of transformation is not to be severed
from instances supplied by Irish literature, such as the story of Tuan
mac Cairill, related in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
15<sup>a</sup>&ndash;16<sup>b</sup>. Tuan relates to St. Finnen of
Magbile, in the sixth century, the early history of Ireland from the
time of Partholan down, which he was enabled to do because he had lived
through it all, passing from one form to another without losing his
memory. First of all he was a man, and when old age had come upon him
he was transformed into a stag of the forest. For a while he was
youthful and vigorous; but again old age overtook him, and he next
became a wild boar. When old age and decrepitude overcame him next he
was renewed in the form of a powerful bird, called in the original
<i>seig</i>. The next renewal was in the form of a salmon: here the
manuscript fails us. The form of a salmon was also the one taken by the
woman Liban when she was overwhelmed by the flood, which became the
body of water known as Lough Neagh: her handmaid at the same time
became an otter (fo. 40<sup>b</sup>). There was an ancient belief that
the soul leaves the body like a bird flying out of the mouth of the man
or woman dying, and this maybe said to approach the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb612" href="#pb612" name=
"pb612">612</a>]</span>favourite Celtic notion illustrated by the
transformations here instanced, to which may be added the case of the
Children of Lir, pp. 93, 549, changed by the stroke of their wicked
stepmother&rsquo;s wand into swans, on Lough Erne. The story has, in
the course of ages, modified itself into a belief that the swans
haunting that beautiful water at all seasons of the year, are the souls
of holy women who fell victims to the repeated visitations of the pagan
Norsemen, when Ireland was at their cruel mercy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8746src" href="#xd26e8746" name="xd26e8746src">7</a>. The
Christian form which the Irish peasant has given the legend does not
touch its relevancy here. Perhaps one might venture to generalize, that
in these islands great men and women were believed to continue their
existence in the form of eagles, hawks or ravens, swans or owls. But
what became of the souls of the obscurer majority of the people? For an
answer to this perhaps we can only fall back on the Psyche butterfly,
which may here be illustrated by the fact that Cornish tradition
applies the term &lsquo;pisky&rsquo; both to the fairies and to moths,
believed in Cornwall by many to be departed souls<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8752src" href="#xd26e8752" name="xd26e8752src">8</a>. So in
Ireland: a certain reverend gentleman named Joseph Ferguson, writing in
1810 a statistical account of the parish of Ballymoyer, in the county
of Armagh, states that one day a girl chasing a butterfly was chid by
her companions, who said to her: &lsquo;That may be the soul of your
grandmother<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8764src" href="#xd26e8764" name=
"xd26e8764src">9</a>.&rsquo; This idea, to survive, has modified itself
into a belief less objectionably pagan, that a butterfly hovering near
a corpse is a sign of its everlasting happiness.</p>
<p>The shape-shifting is sometimes complicated by taking place on the
lines of rebirth: as cases in point <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb613" href="#pb613" name="pb613">613</a>]</span>may be mentioned Lug,
reborn as C&uacute;chulainn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8771src" href=
"#xd26e8771" name="xd26e8771src">10</a>, and the repeated births of
&Eacute;t&aacute;in. This was rendered possible in the case of
C&uacute;chulainn, for instance, by Lug taking the form of an insect
which was unwittingly swallowed by Dechtere, who thereby became
C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s mother; and so in the case of
&Eacute;t&aacute;in<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8783src" href=
"#xd26e8783" name="xd26e8783src">11</a> and her last recorded mother,
the queen of Etar king of Eochraidhe. On Welsh ground we have a
combination of transformations and rebirth in the history of Gwion Bach
in the story of Taliessin. Gwion was in the service of the witch
Ceridwen; but having learned too much of her arts, he became the object
of her lasting hatred; and the incident is translated as follows in
Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>, iii.
358&ndash;9:&mdash;&lsquo;And she went forth after him, running. And he
saw her, and changed himself into a hare and fled. But she changed
herself into a greyhound and turned him. And he ran towards a river,
and became a fish. And she in the form of an otter-bitch chased him
under the water, until he was fain to turn himself into a bird of the
air. Then she, as a hawk, followed him and gave him no rest in the sky.
And just as she was about to swoop upon him, and he was in fear of
death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn, and
he dropped amongst the wheat, and turned himself into one of the
grains. Then she transformed herself into a high-crested black hen, and
went to the wheat and scratched it with her feet, and found him out and
swallowed him. And, as the story says, she bore him nine months, and
when she was delivered of him, she could not find it in her heart
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb614" href="#pb614" name=
"pb614">614</a>]</span>to kill him, by reason of his beauty. So she
wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him into the sea to the mercy
of God on the twenty-ninth day of April. And at that time the weir of
Gwy&#273;no was on the strand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his
own castle, and the value of an hundred pounds was taken in that weir
every May eve.&rsquo; The story goes on to relate how
Gwy&#273;no&rsquo;s son, Elphin, found in the weir the leathern bag
containing the baby, who grew up to be the bard Taliessin. But the
fourteenth century manuscript called after the name of Taliessin teems
with such transformations as the above, except that they are by no
means confined to the range of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. I
heard an amusing suggestion of metempsychosis the other day: it is
related of a learned German, who was sitting at table, let us say, in
an Oxford hotel, with most of his dinner in front of him. Being,
however, a man of immediate foresight, and anxious to accustom himself
to fine English, he was not to be restrained by scruples as to any
possible discrepancy between words like <i lang="de">bekommen</i> and
<i>become</i>. So to the astonishment of everybody he gravely called
out to the waiter, &lsquo;Hereafter I vish to become a Velsh
rabbit.&rsquo; This would have done admirably for the author of certain
poems in the <i>Book of Taliessin</i>, where the bard&rsquo;s changes
are dwelt upon. From them it appears that the transformation might be
into anything that the mind of man could in any way individualize. Thus
Taliessin claims to have been, some time or other, not only a stag or a
salmon, but also an axe, a sword, and even a book in a priest&rsquo;s
hand, or a word in writing. On the whole, however, his history as a
grain of corn has most interest here, as it differs from that which has
just been given: the passage<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8816src" href=
"#xd26e8816" name="xd26e8816src">12</a> is sadly obscure, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb615" href="#pb615" name=
"pb615">615</a>]</span>I understand it to say that the grain was duly
sown on a hill, that it was reaped and finally brought on the hearth,
where the ears of corn were emptied of their grains by the ancient
method of dexterously applying a flame to them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8827src" href="#xd26e8827" name="xd26e8827src">13</a>. But while
the light was being applied the grain which was Taliessin, falling from
the operator&rsquo;s hand, was quickly received and swallowed by a
hostile hen, in whose interior it remained nine nights; but though this
seemingly makes Taliessin&rsquo;s mother a bird, he speaks of himself,
without mentioning any intervening transformation, as a <i>gwas</i> or
young man. Such an origin was perhaps never meant to be other than
incomprehensible. Lastly as to rebirth, I may say that it has often
struck me that the Welsh habit, especially common in Carnarvonshire and
Anglesey, of one child in a family being named, partially or wholly,
after a grandparent, is to be regarded as a trace of the survival from
early times of a belief in such atavism as has been suggested
above<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8840src" href="#xd26e8840" name=
"xd26e8840src">14</a>.</p>
<p>The belief in transformations or transmigrations, such as have been
mentioned, must have lent itself to various developments, and two at
least of them are deserving of some notice here. First may be mentioned
one which connects itself intimately with the druid or magician: he is
master of his own transformations, as in the case of Ceridwen and
Gwion, for he had acquired his magic by tasting of the contents of
Ceridwen&rsquo;s Cauldron of Sciences, and he retained his memory
continuously through his shape-shiftings, as is best illustrated,
perhaps, by the case of Tuan mac Cairill. The next step was for him to
realize his changes, not as matters of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb616" href="#pb616" name="pb616">616</a>]</span>past
but as present and possible; in fact, to lay claim to being anybody or
anything he likes at any moment. Of this we have a remarkable instance
in the case of Amairgen, seer and judge of the Milesians or Sons of
M&iacute;l, in the story of their conquest of Ireland, as told in the
<i>Book of Leinster</i>, fo. 12<sup>b</sup>. As he first sets his right
foot on the land of Erin he sings a lay in which he says, that he is a
boar, a bull, and a salmon, together with other things also, such as
the sea-breeze, the rolling wave, the roar of the billows, and a lake
on the plain. Nor does he forget to pretend to wisdom and science
beyond other men, and to hint that he is the divinity that gives them
knowledge and sense. The similarity between this passage and others in
the <i>Book of Taliessin</i> has attracted the attention of scholars:
see M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Cycle
mythologique irlandais</i>, pp. 242 et seq. On the whole, Taliessin
revels most in the side of the picture devoted to his knowledge and
science: he has passed through so many scenes and changes that he has
been an eye-witness to all kinds of events in Celtic story. Thus he was
with Br&acirc;n on his expedition to Ireland, and saw when Mor&#273;wyt
Ty&#7931;ion was slain in the great slaughter of the Meal-bag Pavilion.
This, however, was not all; he represents himself as also a
<i>sywedy&#273;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8862src" href=
"#xd26e8862" name="xd26e8862src">15</a>, &lsquo;<i>vates</i> or
prophet, astrologer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb617" href="#pb617"
name="pb617">617</a>]</span>and astronomer,&rsquo; a sage who boasts
his knowledge of the physical world and propounds questions which he
challenges his rivals to answer concerning earth and sea, day and
night, sun and moon. He is not only Taliessin, but also Gwion, and
hence one infers his magical powers to have been derived. If he regards
anybody as his equal or superior, that seems to have been Talhaiarn, to
whom he ascribes the greatest science. Talhaiarn is usually thought of
only as a great bard by Welsh writers, but it is his science and wisdom
that Taliessin admires<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8997src" href=
"#xd26e8997" name="xd26e8997src">16</a>, whereby one is to understand,
doubtless, that Talhaiarn, like Taliessin, was a great magician. To
this day Welsh bards and bardism have not been quite dissociated from
magic, in so far as the witch Ceridwen is regarded as their
patroness.</p>
<p>The boasts of Amairgen are characterized by M. d&rsquo;Arbois de
Jubainville as a sort of pantheism, and he detects traces of the same
doctrine, among other places, in the teaching of the Irishman, known as
Scotus Erigena, at the court of Charles the Bald in the ninth century:
see the <i lang="fr">Cycle mythologique</i>, p. 248. In any case, one
is prepared by such utterances as those of Amairgen to understand the
charge recorded in the <i>Senchus M&oacute;r</i>, i. 23, as made
against the Irish druids or magicians of his time by a certain Connla
Cainbhrethach, one of the remarkable judges of Erin, conjectured by
O&rsquo;Curry&mdash;on what grounds I do not know&mdash;to have lived
in the first century of our era. The statement there made is to the
following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;After her came Connla Cainbhrethach,
chief doctor of Connaught; he excelled the men of Erin in wisdom, for
he was filled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb618" href="#pb618" name=
"pb618">618</a>]</span>with the grace of the Holy Ghost; he used to
contend with the druids, who said that it was they that made heaven and
earth, and the sea, &amp;c., and the sun and moon, &amp;c.&rsquo; This
view of the pretensions of the druids is corroborated by the fact that
magic, especially the power of shape-shifting at will, was regarded as
power <i>par excellence</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e9018src" href=
"#xd26e9018" name="xd26e9018src">17</a>, and by the old formula of
wishing one well, which ran thus: <i>Bendacht dee ocus andee fort</i>,
&lsquo;the blessing of gods and not-gods upon thee!&rsquo; The term
&lsquo;gods&rsquo; in this context is explained to have meant persons
of power<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9037src" href="#xd26e9037" name=
"xd26e9037src">18</a>, and the term &lsquo;not-gods&rsquo; farmers or
those connected with the land, probably all those whose lives were
directly dependent on farming and the cultivation of the soil, as
distinguished from professional men such as druids and smiths. This may
be further illustrated by a passage from the account of the second
battle of Moytura, published by Stokes with a translation, in the
<i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xii. 52&ndash;130. See more especially
pp. 74&ndash;6, where we find Lug offering his services to the king,
Nuada of the Silver Hand. Among other qualifications which Lug
possessed, he named that of being a sorcerer, to which the porter at
once replied: &lsquo;We need thee not; we have sorcerers already. Many
are our wizards and our folk of might&rsquo;&mdash;that is, those of
our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb619" href="#pb619" name=
"pb619">619</a>]</span>people who possess power&mdash;<i>ar lucht
cumachtai</i>. Wizards (<i>druith</i>) and <i>lucht cumachtai</i> came,
it is observed, alike under the more general designation of sorcerers
(<i>corrguinigh</i>).</p>
<p>One seems to come upon traces of the same classification of a
community into professionals and non-professionals, for that is what it
comes to, in an obscure Welsh term, <i>Teulu Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, which
may be conjectured to have meant &lsquo;the Household of <i>Oeth</i>
and <i>Anoeth</i>&rsquo; in the sense of Power and Not-power<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9107src" href="#xd26e9107" name=
"xd26e9107src">19</a>. However <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb620"
href="#pb620" name="pb620">620</a>]</span>that may be, the professional
class of men who were treated as persons of power and gods seem to have
attained to their position by virtue of the magic of which they claimed
to be masters, and especially of their supposed faculty of
shape-shifting at will. In other words, the druidic pantheism<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9284src" href="#xd26e9284" name=
"xd26e9284src">20</a> which Erigena was able to dress in the garb of a
fairly respectable philosophy proves to have been, in point of genesis,
but a few removes from a primitive kind of savage folklore.</p>
<p>None of these stories of shape-shifting, and of being born again,
make any allusion to a soul. To revert, for instance, to &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes, it is evident that the eagle cannot be regarded as his
soul. The decayed state of the eagle&rsquo;s body seems to imply that
it was somehow the same body as that of &#7930;ew at the time when he
was wounded by Gronw&rsquo;s poisoned spear: the festering of the
eagle&rsquo;s flesh looks as if considered a continuation of the wound.
It is above all things, however, to be noted that none of the stories
in point, whether Irish or Welsh, contain any suggestion of the
hero&rsquo;s life coming to an end, or in any way perishing; &#7930;ew
lives on to be transformed, under the stroke of Gwydion&rsquo;s wand,
from being an eagle to be a man again; and Tuan mac <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb621" href="#pb621" name=
"pb621">621</a>]</span>Cairill persists in various forms till he meets
St. Finnen in the sixth century. Then in the case of
&Eacute;t&aacute;in, we are told in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
129<sup>a</sup>, that her first-mentioned birth and the next one were
separated by more than a thousand years. So practically we may say that
these stories implied that men and women were imperishable, that they
had no end necessarily to their existence. This sort of notion may be
detected in &#7930;ew&rsquo;s words when he says, &lsquo;Unless God
kill me &hellip; it is not easy to kill me.&rsquo; The reference to the
Almighty may probably be regarded as a comparatively late interpolation
due to Christian teaching. A similar instance seems to occur in a poem
in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, fos.
47<sup>b</sup>&ndash;8<sup>b</sup>, where Arthur loudly sings the
praises of his friend Cai. The couplet in point runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ny&#775; bei duv ae digonhei.</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Oet diheit aghev kei.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Unless it were God that wrought it,</p>
<p class="line">Hard to effect were the death of Cai.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">I am not sure, however, of the meaning; for, among
other things, <i>diheit</i>, which I am inclined to interpret as
&lsquo;hard to reach&rsquo; or &lsquo;not easy to effect,&rsquo; has
been rendered otherwise by others<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9328src"
href="#xd26e9328" name="xd26e9328src">21</a>. In any case, the other
instance seems to imply that at one time the heroes of
&#7930;ew&rsquo;s world were not necessarily expected to die at all;
and when they happened to do so, it was probably regarded, as among
savages at the present day, as a result brought about by magic. Any
reader who may feel astonished at such a crudeness of belief, will find
something to contrast and compare in the familiar doctrine, that but
for the fall of Adam and Eve we should have never heard of death,
whether of man or of beast. But if he proceeds to ask questions about
the economy of our world in case nobody died, he must be satisfied to
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb622" href="#pb622" name=
"pb622">622</a>]</span>told that to ask any such question is here not
only useless but also irrelevant.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that in a society permeated by the crude kind of
notions of which one finds traces in the <i>Mabinogion</i> and other
old Welsh literature, a man arose who had a turn for philosophizing and
trying to think things out: how would he reason? It seems probable that
he would argue, that underneath all the change there must be some
substratum which is permanent. If Tuan, he would say, changed from one
form to another and remembered all that he had gone through, there must
have been something which lasted, otherwise Tuan would have come to an
end early in the story, and the later individual would not be Tuan at
all. Probably one thing which, according to our folklore
philosopher&rsquo;s way of thinking, lasted through the
transformations, was the material of Tuan&rsquo;s body, just as one is
induced to suppose that &#7930;ew&rsquo;s body, and that of the eagle
into which he was transformed, were considered to be one and the same
body labouring under the mortifying influence of the wound inflicted on
&#7930;ew by Gronw&rsquo;s enchanted spear. Further, we have already
found reasons to regard the existence of the soul as forming a part of
the creed of some at any rate of the early inhabitants of this country,
though we have no means of gathering what precise attributes our
philosopher might ascribe to it besides the single one, perhaps, of
continuing to exist. In that case he might otherwise describe
Tuan&rsquo;s shape-shifting as the entrance of Tuan&rsquo;s soul into a
series of different bodies. Now the philosopher here sketched agrees
pretty closely with the little that is known of the Gaulish druid, such
as he is described by ancient authors<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9344src" href="#xd26e9344" name="xd26e9344src">22</a>. The latter
seem to have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb623" href="#pb623"
name="pb623">623</a>]</span>agreed in regarding him as believing in the
immortality of the soul, and several of them appear to have thought his
views similar to those of Pythagoras and his school. So we may perhaps
venture to suppose that the druids, like Pythagoras, believed in the
transmigration of souls, including that from the human to an animal
form and the reverse. If, in the absence of an explicit statement, one
may ascribe this latter form of that belief to the druids, the identity
of their creed becomes almost complete with that of our conjectured
folklore philosopher. At one time I was inclined to fancy that the
druids of Gaul had received no unimportant part of their teaching from
Greek philosophy by way of Massilia, but I am now more disposed to
believe their doctrines to have been gradually developed, in the way
above suggested, from the unfailing resources of that folklore which
revelled in scenes of shape-shifting and rebirth. Possibly the
doctrines of Pythagoras may have themselves had a like origin and a
somewhat parallel development, or let us say rather that the Orphic
notions had, which preceded Pythagoreanism.</p>
<p>But as to Gaul generally, it is not to be assumed that the Gaulish
druids and all the other Gauls held the same opinion on these
questions: we have some evidence that they did <i>not</i>. Thus the
Gauls in the neighbourhood of Massilia<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9371src" href="#xd26e9371" name="xd26e9371src">23</a>, who would
accept a creditor&rsquo;s promise to pay up in the next world, can
hardly have contemplated the possibility of any such creditor being
then a bird or a moth. Should it be objected that the transformations,
instanced above as Brythonic and Goidelic, were assumed only in the
case of magicians and other professional or privileged persons, and
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb624" href="#pb624" name=
"pb624">624</a>]</span>we are not told what was held to happen in the
case of the rank and file of humanity, it is enough to answer that
neither do we know what the druids of Gaul held to be the fate of the
common people of their communities. No lever can be applied in that
direction to disturb the lines of the parallel.</p>
<p>In previous chapters, pp. 45, 54, 61, 88, 97, 229, instances from
Welsh sources have been given of the fairies concealing their names.
But Wales is not the only Celtic land where we find traces of this
treatment of one&rsquo;s name: it is to be detected also on Irish
ground. Thus, when a herald from an enemy&rsquo;s camp comes to parley
with C&uacute;chulainn and his charioteer, the latter, being first
approached, describes himself as the &lsquo;man of the man down
there,&rsquo; meaning C&uacute;chulainn, to whom he pointed; and when
the herald comes to C&uacute;chulainn himself, he asks him whose man he
is: C&uacute;chulainn describes himself as the &lsquo;man of Conchobar
mac Nessa.&rsquo; The herald then inquires if he has no more definite
designation, and C&uacute;chulainn replies that what he has given will
suffice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9381src" href="#xd26e9381" name=
"xd26e9381src">24</a>: neither of the men gives his name. Thus Celts of
both groups, Brythons and Goidels, are at one in yielding evidence to
the same sort of cryptic treatment of personal names, at some stage or
other in their past history.</p>
<p>The student of man tells us, as already pointed out, that the reason
for the reluctance to disclose one&rsquo;s name was of the same nature
as that which makes savages, and some men belonging to nations above
the savage state feel anxious that an enemy should not get possession
of anything identified with their persons, such as a lock of
one&rsquo;s hair, a drop of one&rsquo;s blood, or anything closely
connected with one&rsquo;s person, lest it should give the enemy power
over one&rsquo;s person as a whole, especially if such enemy is
suspected of possessing any skill <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb625"
href="#pb625" name="pb625">625</a>]</span>in handling the terrors of
magic. In other words, the anthropologist would say that the name was
regarded as identified with the person; and, having said this, he has
mostly felt satisfied that he has definitively disposed of the matter.
Therein, however, he is possibly wrong; for when he says that the name
was probably treated as a part of the man, that only leads one to ask
the question, What part of the man? At any rate, I can see nothing very
unreasonable in such a question, though I am quite willing to word it
differently, and to ask: Is there any evidence to show with what part
of a man his name was associated?</p>
<p>As regards the Aryan nations, we seem to have a clue to an answer in
the interesting group of Aryan words in point, from which I select the
following:&mdash;Irish <i>ainm</i>, &lsquo;a name,&rsquo; plural
<i>anmann</i>; Old Welsh <i>anu</i>, now <i>enw</i>, also &lsquo;a
name&rsquo;; Old Bulgarian <i>ime<sup>n</sup></i> (for
<i>*i&#815;enmen</i>, <i>*anman</i>); Old Prussian <i>emnes</i>,
<i>emmens</i>, accusative <i>emnan</i>; and Armenian <i>anwan</i> (for
a stem <i>*anman</i>)&mdash;all meaning a name. To these some
scholars<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9436src" href="#xd26e9436" name=
"xd26e9436src">25</a> would add, and it may be rightly, the English
word <i>name</i> itself, the Latin <i>nomen</i>, the Sanskrit
<i>n&#257;man</i>, and the Greek <span class="trans" title=
"ynoma"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#8020;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span></span>; but, as some
others find a difficulty in thus grouping these words, I abstain from
laying any stress on them. In fact, I have every reason to be satisfied
with the wide extent of the Aryan world covered by the other instances
enumerated as Celtic, Prussian, Bulgarian, and Armenian.</p>
<p>Now, such is the similarity between Welsh <i>enw</i>,
&lsquo;name,&rsquo; and <i>enaid</i>, &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; that I cannot
help referring the two words to one and the same origin, especially
when I see the same or rather greater similarity illustrated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb626" href="#pb626" name=
"pb626">626</a>]</span>by the Irish words, <i>ainm</i>,
&lsquo;name,&rsquo; and <i>anim</i>, &lsquo;soul.&rsquo; This
similarity between the Irish words so pervades the declension of them,
that a beginner frequently falls into the error of confounding them in
medieval texts. Take, for instance, the genitive singular, <i>anma</i>,
which may mean either <i>anim&aelig;</i> or <i>nominis</i>; the
nominative plural, <i>anmand</i>, which may be either
<i>anim&aelig;</i> or <i>nomina</i>; and the gen. <i>anmand</i>, either
<i>animarum</i> or <i>nominum</i>, as the dative <i>anmannaib</i> may
likewise be either <i>animabus</i> or <i>nominibus</i>. In fact, one is
at first sight almost tempted to suppose that the partial
differentiation of the Irish forms was only brought about under the
influence of Latin, with its distinct forms of <i>anima</i> and
<i>nomen</i>. That would be pressing the point too far; but the direct
teaching of the Celtic vocables is that they are all to be referred to
the same origin in the Aryan word for &lsquo;breath or
breathing,&rsquo; which is represented by such words as Latin
<i>anima</i>, Welsh <i>anadl</i>, &lsquo;breath,&rsquo; and a Gothic
<i>anan</i>, &lsquo;blow or breathe,&rsquo; whence the compound
preterite <i>uz-on</i>, twice used by Ulfilas in the fifteenth chapter
of St. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel to render <span class="trans" title=
"exepneuse"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7952;&xi;&#8051;&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&epsilon;</span></span>,
&lsquo;gave up the ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now the lessons which the words here grouped together contain for
the student of man is, that the Celts, and certain other widely
separated Aryans, unless we should rather say the whole of the Aryan
family, were once in the habit of closely associating both the soul and
one&rsquo;s name with the breath of life. The evidence is satisfactory
so far as it goes; but let us go a little more into detail, and see as
exactly as we can to what it commits us. Commencing at the beginning,
we may set out with the axiom that breathing is a physical action, and
that in the temperate zone one&rsquo;s breath is not unfrequently
visible. Then one may say that the men who made the words&mdash;Welsh,
<i>enaid</i> (for an earlier <i>anatio-s</i>), &lsquo;soul&rsquo;;
Irish, <i>anim</i> (from an earlier stem, <i>animon</i>); <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb627" href="#pb627" name=
"pb627">627</a>]</span>Latin, <i>anima</i>, also <i>animus</i>,
&lsquo;feeling, mind, soul&rsquo;; and Greek, <span class="trans"
title="anemos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7940;&nu;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
&lsquo;air, wind&rsquo;&mdash;must have in some way likened the soul to
one&rsquo;s breath, which perhaps first suggested the idea. At all
events they showed not only that they did not contemplate the soul as a
bone, or any solid portion of a man&rsquo;s frame, or even as a manikin
residing inside it: in fact they had made a great advance in the
direction of the abstract notion of a spirit, in which some of them may
have been helped by another association of ideas, namely, that
indicated by speaking of the dead as shades or shadows,
<i>umbr&aelig;</i>, <span class="trans" title="skiai"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&sigma;&kappa;&iota;&alpha;&#8055;</span></span>.
Similarly, the words in point for &lsquo;name&rsquo; seem to prove that
some of the ancient Aryans must have, in some way, associated
one&rsquo;s name with the breath of life. On the other hand, we find
nothing to show that the name and the soul were directly compared or
associated with one another, while the association of the name with the
breath represents, probably, a process as much earlier as it is cruder,
than likening the soul to the breath and naming it accordingly. This is
countenanced to some extent by the general physiognomy, so to say, of
words like <i>enaid</i>, <i>anima</i>, as contrasted with <i>enw</i>,
<i>ainm</i>, <i>nomen</i>, <i>name</i>. Speaking relatively, the former
might be of almost any date in point of comparative lateness, while the
latter could not, belonging as they do to a small declension which was
not wont to receive accessions to its numbers.</p>
<p>In what way, then, or in what respect did early folklore identify
the name with the breath? Before one could expect to answer this
question in anything like a convincing fashion, one would have to
examine the collector of the folklore of savages, or rather to induce
him to cross-examine them on the point. For instance, among the
Singhalese<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9616src" href="#xd26e9616" name=
"xd26e9616src">26</a>, when in the ceremony of name-giving the father
utters the baby&rsquo;s name in a low <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb628" href="#pb628" name="pb628">628</a>]</span>whisper in the
baby&rsquo;s ear, is that called breathing the name? and is the name so
whispered called a breath or a breathing? In the case of the savages
who name their children at their birth, is the reason ever advanced
that a name must be given to the child in order to make it breathe, or,
at least, in order to facilitate its breathing? Some such a notion of
reinforcing the child&rsquo;s vitality and safety would harmonize well
enough with the fact that, as Mr. Clodd<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9624src" href="#xd26e9624" name="xd26e9624src">27</a> puts it,
&lsquo;Barbaric, Pagan, and Christian folklore is full of examples of
the importance of naming and other birth-ceremonies, in the belief that
the child&rsquo;s life is at the mercy of evil spirits watching the
chance of casting spells upon it, of demons covetous to possess it, and
of fairies eager to steal it and leave a &ldquo;changeling&rdquo; in
its place.&rsquo; Provisionally, one must perhaps rest content to
suppose the association of the name to have taken place with the breath
regarded as an accompaniment of life. Looked at in that sense, the name
becomes associated with one&rsquo;s life, and, speaking roughly, with
one&rsquo;s person; and it is interesting to notice that one seems to
detect traces in Welsh literature of some confusion of the kind. Thus,
when the hero of the story of Kulhwch and Olwen was christened he was
named Kulhwch, which is expressed in Welsh as &lsquo;forcing or driving
Kulhwch on him&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">gyrru kulh&#7933;ch
arna&#7933;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e9632src" href="#xd26e9632"
name="xd26e9632src">28</a>); <i>Kulh&#7933;ch</i>, be it noticed, not
the name Kulhwch. Similarly when Br&acirc;n, on the eve of his
expedition to Ireland, left seven princes, or knights as they are also
called, to take charge of his dominions, we have an instance of the
kind. The stead or town was named after the seven knights, and it is a
place which is now known as <i>Bryn y Saith Marchog</i>, &lsquo;the
Hill of the Seven Knights,&rsquo; near Gwy&#273;elwern, in
Merionethshire. But the wording of the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen is
<i lang="cy">o acha&#7933;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb629" href=
"#pb629" name="pb629">629</a>]</span>hynny y dodet seith marcha&#7933;c
ar y dref</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e9652src" href="#xd26e9652"
name="xd26e9652src">29</a>, meaning &lsquo;for that reason the stead
was called Seven Knights,&rsquo; literally &lsquo;for that reason one
put Seven Knights on the stead.&rsquo; In Guest&rsquo;s
<i>Mabinogion</i>, iii. 116, this will be found rendered wrongly,
though not wholly without excuse&mdash;&lsquo;for this reason were the
seven knights placed in the town.&rsquo; It is probable that the
redactor of the stories from which the two foregoing instances
come&mdash;and more might be cited&mdash;was not so much courting
ambiguities as adhering to an old form of expression which neglected
from the first to distinguish, in any formal way, between names and the
persons or things which they would, in modern phraseology, be said to
represent<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9661src" href="#xd26e9661" name=
"xd26e9661src">30</a>.</p>
<p>An instance has been already mentioned of a man&rsquo;s name being
put or set on him, or rather forced on him: at any rate, his name is
<i>on</i> him both in Welsh and Irish, and the latter language also
speaks of it as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb630" href="#pb630"
name="pb630">630</a>]</span>cleaving or adhering to him. Neither
language contemplates the name, however closely identified with him, as
having become an inseparable part of him, or else as something he has
secured for himself. In the neo-Celtic tongues, both Welsh and Irish,
all things which a man owns, and all things for which he takes credit,
are <i>with</i> him or <i>by</i> him; but all things which he cannot
help having, whether creditable or discreditable, if they are regarded
as coming from without are <i>on</i> him, not <i>with</i> him. Thus, if
he is wealthy there is money with him; but if he is in debt and owes
money, the money is on him. Similarly, if he rejoices there is joy with
him; whereas if he is ashamed or afraid, shame or fear is on him. This
is a far-reaching distinction, of capital importance in Celtic
phraseology, and judged by this criterion the name is something from
without the man, something which he cannot take credit to himself for
having acquired by his own direct willing or doing. This is to be borne
in mind when one speaks of the name as identified or closely bound up
with one&rsquo;s life and personality. But this qualified
identification of the name with the man is also what one may infer from
savage folklore; for many, perhaps most, of the nations who name their
children at their birth, have those names changed when the children
grow up. That is done when a boy has to be initiated into the mysteries
of his tribe or of a guild, or it may be when he has achieved some
distinction in war. In most instances, it involves a serious ceremony
and the intervention of the wise man, whether the medicine-man of a
savage system, or the priest of a higher religion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9768src" href="#xd26e9768" name="xd26e9768src">31</a>. In the
ancient Wales of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and in pagan Ireland,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb631" href="#pb631" name=
"pb631">631</a>]</span>the name-giving was done, subject to certain
conditions, at the will and on the initiative of the druid, who was at
the same time tutor and teacher of the youth to be renamed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9779src" href="#xd26e9779" name=
"xd26e9779src">32</a>. Here I may be allowed to direct attention to the
two following facts: the druid, recalling as he does the magician of
the Egypt of the Pentateuch and the shaman of the Mongolian world of
our own time, represented a profession probably not of Celtic origin.
In the next place, his method of selecting names from incidents was
palpably incompatible with what is known to have been the Aryan system
of nomenclature, by means of compounds, as evinced by the annals of
most nations of the Aryan family of speech: such compounds, I mean, as
Welsh <i>Pen-wyn</i>, &lsquo;white-headed,&rsquo; Gaulish <span class=
"trans" title="Penno-ouindos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Pi;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&omicron;-&omicron;&upsilon;&iota;&nu;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
or Greek <span class="trans" title="Hipparchos"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&#7997;&pi;&pi;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
<span class="trans" title="Archippos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7948;&rho;&chi;&iota;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
and the like. Briefly, one may say that the association of the name
with the breath of life was probably Aryan, but without, perhaps, being
unfamiliar to the aborigines of the British Isles before their conquest
by the Celts. On the other hand, in the druid and his method of naming
we seem to touch the non-Aryan substratum, and to detect something
which was not Celtic, not Aryan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9822src"
href="#xd26e9822" name="xd26e9822src">33</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader will not regard it as wholly irrelevant if here I
change the subject for a while from one&rsquo;s name to other words and
locutions in so far as they may be regarded as illustrative of the
mental surroundings in which the last paragraph leaves the name. I
allude especially to the exaggerated influence associated with a form
of words, more particularly among the Irish Celts. O&rsquo;Curry gives
a tragic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb632" href="#pb632" name=
"pb632">632</a>]</span>instance: the poet N&eacute;de mac Adnai, in
order to obtain possession of the throne of Connaught, asked an
impossible request of the king, who was his own father&rsquo;s brother
and named Caier. When the king declared his inability to accede to his
demand the poet made the refusal his excuse for composing on the king
what was called in Irish an <i>&aacute;ir</i> or <i>&aacute;er</i>,
written later <i>aor</i>, &lsquo;satire,&rsquo; which ran approximately
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Evil, death, short life to Caier!</p>
<p class="line">May spears of battle wound Caier!</p>
<p class="line">Caier quenched, Caier forced, Caier underground!</p>
<p class="line">Under ramparts, under stones with Caier!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">O&rsquo;Curry goes on to relate how Caier, washing his
face at the fountain next morning, discovered that it had three
blisters on it, which the satire had raised, to wit, disgrace, blemish,
and defect, in colours of crimson, green, and white. So Caier fleeing,
that his plight might not be seen of his friends, came to Dun Cearmna
(now the Old Head of Kinsale, in county Cork), the residence of
Caichear, chief of that district. There Caier was well received as a
stranger of unknown quality, while N&eacute;de assumed the sovereignty
of Connaught. In time, N&eacute;de came to know of Caier being there,
and rode there in Caier&rsquo;s chariot. But as N&eacute;de approached
Caier escaped through his host&rsquo;s house and hid himself in the
cleft of a rock, whither N&eacute;de followed Caier&rsquo;s greyhound;
and when Caier saw N&eacute;de, the former dropped dead of
shame<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9853src" href="#xd26e9853" name=
"xd26e9853src">34</a>. This abstract of the story as told by
O&rsquo;Curry, will serve to show how the words of the satirist were
dreaded by high and low among the ancient Irish, and how their demands
had to be at once obeyed. It is a commonplace of Irish literature that
the satirist&rsquo;s words unfailingly raised blisters on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb633" href="#pb633" name=
"pb633">633</a>]</span>face of him at whom they were aimed. A portion
at least of the potency of the poet&rsquo;s words seems to have been
regarded as due to their being given a certain metrical form. That,
however, does not show how the poet had acquired his influence, and one
cannot shut one&rsquo;s eyes to the fact that the means he might adopt
to make his influence felt and his wishes instantly attended to,
implied that the race with which he had to deal was a highly sensitive
one: I may perhaps apply to it the adjective thin-skinned, in the
literal sense of that word. For the blisters on the face are only an
exaggeration of a natural phenomenon. On this point my attention has
been called by a friend to the following passages in a review of a work
on the pathology of the emotions<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9864src"
href="#xd26e9864" name="xd26e9864src">35</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To both the hurtful and curative effects of the emotions M.
F&eacute;r&eacute; devotes much attention, and on these points makes
some interesting remarks. That the emotions act on the body, more by
their effects on the circulation than by anything else, is no new
thesis, but M. F&eacute;r&eacute; is developing some new branches of
it. That the heart may be stopped for a few seconds, and that there may
be localised flush and pallor of the skin, owing to almost any strong
emotion, whether it be joy, anger, fear, or pain, is a matter of common
observation; and that there may be many changes of nutrition due to
vaso-motor disturbance is a point easy to establish. The skin is
particularly easily affected; passion and pain may produce a sweat that
is truly hemorrhagic (Parrot); and the scientific world is obliged to
admit that in the stigmata of Louise Lateau the blood vessels were
really broken, and not broken by anything else <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb634" href="#pb634" name="pb634">634</a>]</span>than
an emotional state as cause. In a shipwreck Follain tells us that the
pilot was covered in an hour with pustules from his fear; and the
doctor sees many <i>dermato-neuroses</i>, such as nettle-rash, herpes,
pemphigus, vitiligo, &amp;c, from the <i lang="fr">choc
moral</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I can illustrate this from my own observation: when I was an
undergraduate there was with me at college a Welsh undergraduate, who,
when teased or annoyed by his friends, was well known to be subject to
a sort of rash or minute pustules on his face: it would come on in the
course of an hour or so. There is a well-known Welsh line on this
subject of the face which is to the point:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ni chel gru&#273; gystu&#273; c&agrave;lon.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The cheek hides not the heart&rsquo;s affliction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">So a man who was insulted, or whose honour was
assailed, might be said to be thereby put to the blush or to be
otherwise injured in his face; and the Irish word <i>enech</i>,
&lsquo;face,&rsquo; is found commonly used as a synonym for one&rsquo;s
honour or good name. The same appears to have been the case with the
Welsh equivalent, <i>wyneb</i>, &lsquo;face,&rsquo; and <i>dyn
di-wyneb</i>, literally &lsquo;a faceless man,&rsquo; appears to be now
used in Carnarvonshire and Glamorgan in the sense of one who is without
a sense of honour, an unprincipled fellow. So when Welsh law dealt with
insults and attacks on one&rsquo;s honour the payment to be made to the
injured person was called <i>gwynebwerth</i>, &lsquo;the price of
one&rsquo;s face,&rsquo; or <i>gwynebwarth</i>, &lsquo;the payment for
disgracing one&rsquo;s face.&rsquo; Irish law arranged for similar
damages, and called them by analogous names, such as <i>enech-gris</i>,
&lsquo;a fine for injuring or raising a blush on the face,&rsquo; and
<i>enech-l&oacute;g</i> or <i>enech-lann</i>, &lsquo;honour
price&rsquo;; compare also <i>enech-ruice</i>, &lsquo;a face-reddening
or blushing caused by some act or scandal which brought shame on a
family.&rsquo; Possibly one has to do with traces of somewhat the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb635" href="#pb635" name=
"pb635">635</a>]</span>same type of &lsquo;face,&rsquo; though it has
faded away to the verge of vanishing, when one speaks in English of
keeping another in countenance.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that if a magician got a man&rsquo;s name he
could injure him by means of his arts: now the converse seems to have
been the case with the Irish <i>&aacute;er</i> or satire, for to be
effective it had, as in the instance of Caier, to mention the
victim&rsquo;s name; and a curious instance occurs in the <i>Book of
Leinster</i>, fo. 117, where the poet Atherne failed to curse a person
whose name he could not manipulate according to the rules of his
satire. This man Atherne is described as inhospitable, stingy, and
greedy to the last degree. So it is related how he sallied forth one
day, taking with him a cooked pig and a pot of mead, to a place where
he intended to gorge himself without being observed. But no sooner had
he settled down to his meal than he saw a man approaching, who remarked
to him on his operating on the food all alone, and unceremoniously
picked up the porker and the pot of mead. As he was coolly walking away
with them, Atherne cried out after him, &lsquo;What is thy name?&rsquo;
The stranger replied that it was nothing very grand, and gave it as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Sethor . ethor . othor . sele . dele . dreng
gerce</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mec gerlusce . ger ger . d&iacute;r d&iacute;r issed
moainmse.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sethor-Ethor-Othor-Sele-Dele-Dreng gerce</p>
<p class="line">Son of Gerlusce ger-ger-d&iacute;r-d&iacute;r, that is
my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The story goes on to say that Atherne neither saw his
meal any more nor succeeded in making a satire on the name of the
stranger, who accordingly got away unscathed. It was surmised, we are
told, that he was an angel come from God to teach the poet better
manners. This comic story brings us back to the importance of the name,
as it implies that the cursing poet, had he been able to seize it and
duly work it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb636" href="#pb636" name=
"pb636">636</a>]</span>into his satire, could not have failed to bring
about the intruder&rsquo;s discomfiture. The magician and folklore
philosopher, far from asking with Juliet, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in a
name?&rsquo; would have rather put it the other way,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s not in a name?&rsquo; At any rate the ancients
believed that there was a great deal in a name, and traces of the
importance which they gave it are to be found in modern speech: witness
the article on <i>name</i> or its equivalent in a big dictionary of any
language possessed of a great literature.</p>
<p>It has been seen that it is from the point of view of magic that the
full importance of one&rsquo;s name was most keenly realized by our
ancient Celts; that is, of magic more especially in that stage of its
history when it claimed as its own a certain degree of skill in the art
of verse-making. Perhaps, indeed, it would be more accurate to suppose
that verse-making appertained from the outset to magic, and that it was
magicians, medicine-men, or seers, who, for their own use, first
invented the aids of rhythm and metre. The subject, however, of magic
and its accessories is far too vast to be treated here: it has been
touched upon here and there in some of the previous chapters, and I may
add that wizardry and magic form the machinery, so to say, of the
stories called in Welsh the &lsquo;Four Branches of the
<i>Mabinogi</i>&rsquo; namely those of Pwy&#7931;, Branwen,
Manawy&#273;an, and Math. Now these four, together with the adventure
of &#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys, and, in a somewhat qualified
sense, the story of Kulhwch and Olwen, represent in a Brythonicized
form the otherwise lost legends of the Welsh Goidels; and, like those
of the Irish Goidels, they are remarkable for their wizardry. Nor is
that all, for in the former the kings are mostly the greatest magicians
of their time: or shall I rather put it the other way, and say that in
them the greatest magicians function as kings? Witness Math son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb637" href="#pb637" name=
"pb637">637</a>]</span>of Mathonwy king of Gwyne&#273;, and his
sister&rsquo;s son, Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n, to whom as his successor he
duly taught his magic; then come the arch-enchanter Arawn, king of
Annwn, and Caswa&#7931;on ab Beli, represented as winning his kingdom
by the sheer force of magic. To these might be added other members of
the kingly families whose story shows them playing the r&ocirc;le of
magicians, such as Rhiannon, who by her magic arts foiled her powerful
suitor, Gwawl ab Cl&ucirc;d, and secured as her consort the man of her
choice, Pwy&#7931; prince of Dyfed. Here also, perhaps, one might
mention Manawy&#273;an ab &#7930;yr, who, as Manann&aacute;n mac Lir,
figures in the stories of the Goidels of Erin and Man as a consummate
wizard and first king of the Manx people: see p. 314 above. In the
<i>Mabinogi</i>, however, no act of magic is ascribed to
Manawy&#273;an, though he is represented successfully checkmating the
most formidable wizard arrayed against him and his friends, to wit,
&#7930;wyd ab Kilcoed. Not only does one get the impression that the
ruling class in these stories of the Welsh Goidels had their magic
handed down from generation to generation according to a fixed rule of
maternal succession (pp. 326, 503, 505), but it supplies the complete
answer to and full explanation of questions as to the meaning of the
terms already mentioned, <i>Tuatha D&eacute; ocus And&eacute;</i>, and
<i>Lucht Cumachtai</i>, together with its antithesis. Within the
magic-wielding class exercising dominion over the shepherds and tillers
of the soil of the country, it is but natural to suppose that the first
king was the first magician or greatest medicine-man, as in the case of
Manann&aacute;n in the Isle of Man. This must of course be understood
to apply to the early history of the Goidelic race, or, perhaps more
correctly speaking, to one of the races which had contributed to its
composition: to the aborigines, let us say, by whatsoever name or names
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb638" href="#pb638" name=
"pb638">638</a>]</span>you may choose to call them, whether Picts or
Ivernians. It is significant, among other things, that our traditions
should connect the potency of ancient wizardry with descent in the
female line of succession, and, in any case, one cannot be wrong in
assuming magic to have begun very low down in the scale of social
progress, probably lower than religion, with which it is essentially in
antagonism. As the crude and infantile pack of notions, collectively
termed sympathetic magic&mdash;beginning with the belief that any
effect may be produced by imitating the action of the cause of it, or
even doing anything that would recall it<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9975src" href="#xd26e9975" name="xd26e9975src">36</a>&mdash;grew
into the panoply of the magician, he came to regard himself, and to be
regarded by others, as able for his own benefit and that of his friends
to coerce all possible opponents, whether men or demons, heroes or
gods. This left no room for the attitude of prayer and worship:
religion in that sense could only come later. <span class=

<i>Sywedy&#273;</i> is probably a word of Goidelic origin: compare
Irish <i>s&uacute;i</i>, &lsquo;a sage,&rsquo; genitive
<i>s&uacute;ad</i>, and derivative <i>s&uacute;ithe</i>,
&lsquo;wisdom.&rsquo; Stokes suggests the derivation <i>su-vet</i>, in
which case <i>s&uacute;i</i> = <i>su-vi</i>, for <i>su-viss</i> =
<i>su-vet-s</i>, and <i>s&uacute;-ithe</i> = <i>suveti&#815;a</i>,
while the Welsh <i>sywedy&#273;</i> is formally <i>su-veti&#815;os</i>
or <i>su-vetii&#815;os</i>. Welsh has also <i>syw</i>, from
<i>s&uacute;i</i>, like <i>dryw</i>, &lsquo;a druid,&rsquo; from
Goidelic <i>dr&uacute;i</i>. <i>Syw</i>, it is true, now only means
elegant, tidy; but Dr. Davies of Ma&#7931;wyd believed its original
signification to have been &lsquo;<i lang="la">sapiens, doctus,
peritus</i>.&rsquo; The root <i>vet</i> is most probably to be
identified with the <i>wet</i> of Med. Welsh <i>gwet-id</i>, &lsquo;a
saying,&rsquo; <i>dy-wawt</i>, &lsquo;<i>dixit</i>,&rsquo; whence it
appears that the bases were <i>v&#277;t</i> and <i>v&#257;t</i>, with
the latter of which Irish <i>f&aacute;ith</i>, &lsquo;a poet or
prophet,&rsquo; Latin <i>v&#257;tes</i>, agrees, as also the Welsh
<i>gwawd</i>, &lsquo;poetry, sarcasm,&rsquo; and in Mod. Welsh,
&lsquo;any kind of derision.&rsquo; In the <i>Book of Taliessin</i>
<i>syw</i> has, besides the plurals <i>sywyon</i> and <i>sywydon</i>
(Skene, ii. 142, 152), possibly an older plural, <i>sywet</i> (p. 155)
= <i>su-vet-es</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb617n" href=
"#pb617n" name="pb617n">617</a>]</span>while for <i>s&uacute;ithe</i> =
<i>su-veti&#815;a</i> we seem to have <i>sywyd</i> or <i>sewyd</i> (pp.

as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Of these are the <i>Tuatha Dee</i> and

think it probable, judging from the intelligence of the <i>Tuatha</i>

Evans&rsquo; <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, fo. 33<sup>b</sup>; also
the <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 104, 306. The Irish <i>lucht cumachtai</i>
would be in Welsh literally rendered <i>&#7931;wyth cyfoeth</i>,
&lsquo;the <i>cyfoeth</i> tribe or host,&rsquo; as it were. For
<i>cyfoeth</i>, in Med. Welsh, meant power or dominion, whence
<i>cyfoethog</i>, &lsquo;powerful,&rsquo; and
<i>ho&#7931;-gyfoethog</i>, &lsquo;almighty&rsquo;; but in Mod. Welsh
<i>cyfoeth</i> and <i>cyfoethog</i> have been degraded to mean
&lsquo;riches&rsquo; and &lsquo;rich&rsquo; respectively. Now if we
dropped the prefix <i>cum</i> from the Irish <i>cumachtai</i>, and its
equivalent <i>cyf</i> from the Welsh <i>cyfoeth</i>, we should have
<i>lucht cumachtai</i> reduced to an approximate analogy to
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e9160" title=
"Source: llwyth">&#7931;wyth</span></i> <i>Oeth</i>, &lsquo;the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e9167" title=
"Source: Oeth"><i>Oeth</i></span> tribe,&rsquo; for which we have the
attested equivalent <i>Teulu Oeth</i>, &lsquo;the <i>Oeth</i> household
or family.&rsquo; <i>Oeth</i>, however, seems to have meant powerful
rather than power, and this seems to have been its force in
Gwalchmai&rsquo;s poetry of the twelfth century, where I find it twice:
see the <i>Myvyrian Arch.</i>, i. 196<sup>b</sup>, 203<sup>a</sup>. In
the former passage we have <i>oeth dybydaf o dybwyf ryd</i>, &lsquo;I
shall be powerful if I be free,&rsquo; and in the latter <i>oeth ym
uthrwyd</i>, &lsquo;mightily was I astonished or dismayed.&rsquo;
<i>An-oeth</i> was the negative of <i>oeth</i>, and meant weak, feeble,
frivolous: so we find its plural, <i>anoetheu</i>, applied in the story
of Kulhwch to the strange quests on which Kulhwch had to engage himself
and his friends, before he could hope to obtain Olwen to be his wife.
This has its parallel in the use of the adjective <i>gwan</i>,
&lsquo;weak,&rsquo; in the following instance among them:&mdash;Arthur
and his men were ready to set out in search of Mabon son of Modron, who
was said to have been kidnapped, when only three nights old, from
between his mother Modron and the wall; and though this had happened a
fabulously long time before Arthur was born, nothing had ever been
since heard of Mabon&rsquo;s fate. Now Arthur&rsquo;s men said that
they would set out in search of him, but they considered that Arthur
should not accompany them on feeble quests of the kind: their words
were (p. 128), <i lang="cy">ny e&#7931;i di uynet ath lu y
geissa&#7933; peth mor</i> uan <i lang="cy">ar rei hynn</i>,
&lsquo;thou canst not go with thy army to seek a thing so <i>weak</i>
as these are.&rsquo; Here we have <i>uan</i> as the synonym of
<i>an-oeth</i>; but <i>Oeth ac Anoeth</i> probably became a phrase
which was seldom analysed or understood; so we have besides <i>Teulu
Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, a <i>Caer Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, or fortress of O. and
A., and a <i>Carchar Caer Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, or the Prison of Caer O.
and A., which is more shortly designated also <i>Carchar Oeth ac
Anoeth</i>, or the Prison of O. and A. A late account of the building
of that strange prison and fortress by Manawy&#273;an is given in the
<i>Iolo MSS.</i>, pp. 185&ndash;6, 263, and it is needless to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb620n" href="#pb620n" name=
"pb620n">620</a>]</span>point out that Manawy&#273;an, son of
&#7930;yr, was no other than the Manann&aacute;n mac Lir of Irish
literature, the greatest wizard among the Tuatha D&eacute; or Tuatha
D&eacute; Danann; for the practical equivalence of those names is
proved by the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 16<sup>b</sup>. For
further details about <i>Oeth</i> and <i>Anoeth</i>, Silvan
Evans&rsquo; <i>Geiriadur</i> may be consulted, s. v. <i>Anoeth</i>,
where instances are cited of the application of those terms to tilled
land and wild or uncultivated land. Here the words seem to have the
secondary meanings of profitable and unprofitable lands, respectively:
compare a somewhat analogous use of <i>grym</i>, &lsquo;strength,
force,&rsquo; in a passage relating to the mutilated horses of
Matholwch&mdash;<i>hyt nad oed</i> rym <i>a e&#7931;it ar meirch</i>,
&lsquo;so that no use was possible in the case of the horses,&rsquo;
meaning that they were of no use whatever, or that they had been done
for: see the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 29, and Lady Charlotte

Irish, I would not lay much stress on the question &lsquo;What is your
name?&rsquo; being put, in a fourteenth or fifteenth century version of
the French story of Fierabras, as <i lang="cy">ca hainm
t&uacute;</i>?&mdash;literally, &lsquo;what name art thou?&rsquo; see
the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xix. 28. It may be mentioned here
that the Irish writers of glossaries had a remarkable way of appearing
to identify words and things. Thus, for instance, Cormac has
<i>Cruimther .i. G&aelig;delg indi as presbyter</i>, which
O&rsquo;Donovan (edited by Stokes) has translated, p. 30, as
&lsquo;<i>Cruimther</i>, i. e. the Gaelic of <i lang=
"la">presbyter</i>&rsquo;: literally it would be rather &lsquo;of the
thing which is presbyter.&rsquo; Similarly, Cormac&rsquo;s explanation
of the Irish <i>aiminn</i>, now <i>aoibhinn</i>,
&lsquo;delightful,&rsquo; runs thus in Latin, <i lang="la">Aimind ab eo
quod est amoenum</i>, &lsquo;from the word <i>amoenus</i>,&rsquo;
literally, &lsquo;from that which is <i>amoenus</i>.&rsquo; But this
construction is a favourite one of Latin grammarians, and instances
will be found in Professor Lindsay&rsquo;s <i>Latin Language</i>
(Oxford, 1894), pp. 26, 28, 42, 53. On calling his attention to it, he
kindly informed me that it can be traced as far back as Varro, from
whose <i>Lingua Latina</i>, vi. 4, he cites <i>Meridies ab eo quod
medius dies</i>. So in this matter, Irish writers have merely imitated
their Latin models; and one detects a trace of the same imitation in
some of the Old Welsh glosses, for instance in the <i lang=
"la">Juvencus Codex</i>, where we have <span class=
"xd26e9710">XPS</span> explained as <i lang="ga">irhinn issid

<p class="first">The method of philological mythology is thus

who enters the sacred enclosure.&mdash;<span class="sc">Andrew

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been well said, that while it is not science to
know the contents of myths, it is science to know why the human race
has produced them. It is not my intention to trace minutely the history
of that science, but I may hazard the remark, that she could not be
said to have reached years of discretion till she began to compare one
thing with another; and even when mythology had become comparative
mythology, her horizon remained till within recent years comparatively
narrow. In other words, the comparisons were wont to be very
circumscribed: you might, one was told, compare the myths of Greeks and
Teutons and Hindus, because those nations were considered to be of the
same stock; but even within that range comparisons were scarcely
contemplated, except in the case of myths enshrined in the most
classical literatures of those nations. This kind of mythology was
eclectic rather than comparative, and it was apt to regard myths as a
mere disease of language. By-and-by, however, the student showed a
preference for a larger field and a wider range; and in so doing he
was, whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb640" href="#pb640" name=
"pb640">640</a>]</span>consciously or unconsciously, beginning to keep
step with a larger movement extending to the march of all the kindred
sciences, and especially that of language.</p>
<p>At one time the student of language was satisfied with mummified
speech, wrapped up, as it were, in the musty coils of the records of
the past: in fact, he often became a mere researcher of the dead letter
of language, instead of a careful observer of the breath of life
animating her frame. So long as that remained the case, glottology
deserved the whole irony of Voltaire&rsquo;s well-known account of
etymology as being in fact, &lsquo;une science o&ugrave; les voyelles
ne font rien, et les consonnes fort peu de chose.&rsquo; In the course,
however, of recent years a great change has come over the scene: not
only have the laws of the Aryan consonants gained greatly in precision,
but those of the Aryan vowels have at last been discovered to a
considerable extent. The result for me and others who learnt that the
Aryan peasant of idyllic habits harped eternally on the three notes of
<i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, is that we have to unlearn this and a
great deal more: in fact, the vowels prove to be far more troublesome
than the consonants. But difficult as these lessons are, the
glottologist must learn them, unless he is content to remain with the
stragglers who happen to be unable to move on. Now the change to which
I allude, in connexion with the study of language, has been inseparably
accompanied with the paying of increased attention to actual speech,
with a more careful scrutiny of dialects, even obscure dialects such as
the literary man is wont to regard with scorn.</p>
<p>Similarly the student of mythology now seeks the wherewithal of his
comparisons from the mouth of the traveller and the missionary,
wherever they may roam; not from the <i>Rig-Veda</i> or the
<i>Iliad</i> alone, but from the rude stories of the peasant, and the
wild fancies of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb641" href="#pb641"
name="pb641">641</a>]</span>the savage from Tierra del Fuego to
Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains. The parallel may be drawn still
closer. Just as the glottologist, fearing lest the written letter may
have slurred over or hidden away important peculiarities of ancient
speech, resorts for a corrective to the actuality of modern Aryan, so
the mythologist, apt to suspect the testimony of the highly respectable
bards of the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, may on occasion give ear to the fresh
evidence of a savage, however inconsequent it may sound. The movements
to which I allude in glottology and mythology began so recently that
their history has not yet been written. Suffice it to say that in
glottology, or the science of language, the names most intimately
connected with the new departure are those of Ascoli, J. Schmidt, and
Fick, those of Leskien, Brugmann, Osthoff, and De Saussure; while of
the names of the teachers of the anthropological method of studying
myths, several are by this time household words in this country. But,
so far as I know, the first to give a systematic exposition of the
subject was Professor Tylor, in his work on <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
published first in 1871.</p>
<p>Such has been the intimate connexion between mythology and
glottology that I may be pardoned for going back again to the latter.
It is applicable in its method to all languages, but, as a matter of
fact, it came into being in the domain of Aryan philology, so that it
has been all along principally the science of comparing the Aryan
languages with one another. It began with Sir William Jones&rsquo;
discovery of the kinship of Sanskrit with Greek and Latin, and for a
long time it took the lead of the more closely related sciences: this
proved partly beneficial and partly the reverse. In the case of
ethnology, for instance, the influence of glottology has probably done
more harm than good, since it has opened up a wide field for
confounding race with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb642" href=
"#pb642" name="pb642">642</a>]</span>language. In the case of mythology
the same influence has been partly helpful, and it has partly fallen
short of being such. Where names could be analysed with certainty, and
where they could be equated, leaving little room for doubt, as in the
case of that of the Greek <span class="trans" title="Zeus"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span>, the
Norse <i>T&yacute;r</i>, and the Sanskrit <i>Dyaus</i>, the science of
language rendered a veritable help to mythology; but where the students
of language, all pointing in different directions, claimed each to hold
in his hand the one safety-lamp, beyond the range of which the
mythologist durst not take a single step except at the imminent risk of
breaking his neck, the help may be pronounced, to say the least of it,
as somewhat doubtful. The anthropological method of studying myths put
an end to the unequal relation between the students of the two
sciences, and it is now pretty well agreed that the proper relationship
between them is that of mutual aid. This will doubtless prove the
solution of the whole matter, but it would be premature to say that the
period of strained relations is quite over, since the mythologist has
so recently made good his escape from the embarrassing attentions of
the students of language, that he has not yet quite got out of his ears
the bewildering notes of the chorus of discordant cries of
&lsquo;Dawn,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sun,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Storm-cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now that I have touched on the friendly relations which ought to
exist between the science of language and the science of myth, I may
perhaps be allowed to notice a point or two where it is possible or
desirable for the one to render service to the other. The student of
language naturally wants the help of the student of myth, ritual, and
religion on matters which most immediately concern his own department
of study; and I may perhaps be excused for taking my stand on Celtic
ground, and calling attention to some of my own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb643" href="#pb643" name=
"pb643">643</a>]</span>difficulties. Here is one of them: when one
would say in English &lsquo;It rains&rsquo; or &lsquo;It
freezes,&rsquo; I should have to say in my own language, <i>Y mae
hi&rsquo;n bwrw glaw</i> and <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n rhewi</i>, which
literally means &lsquo;She is casting rain&rsquo; and &lsquo;She is
freezing.&rsquo; Nor is this sort of locution confined to weather
topics, for when you would say &lsquo;He is badly off&rsquo; or
&lsquo;He is hard up,&rsquo; a Welshman might say, <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n
&#273;rwg arno</i> or <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n galed arno</i>, that is
literally, &lsquo;She is evil on him&rsquo; or &lsquo;She is hard on
him.&rsquo; And the same feminine pronoun fixes itself in other
locutions in the language. Now I wish to invoke the student of myth,
ritual, and religion to help in the identification of this ubiquitous
&lsquo;she&rsquo; of the Welsh. Whenever it is mentioned to Englishmen,
it merely calls to their minds the Highland &lsquo;she&rsquo; of
English and Scotch caricature, as for instance when Sir Walter Scott
makes Donald appeal in the following strain to Lord Menteith&rsquo;s
man, Anderson, who had learnt manners in France: &lsquo;What the deil,
man, can she no drink after her ain master without washing the cup and
spilling the ale, and be tamned to her!&rsquo; The Highlander denies
the charge which our caricature tries to fasten on him; but even
granting that it was once to some extent justified, it is easy to
explain it by a reference to Gaelic, where the pronouns <i>se</i> and
<i>sibh</i>, for &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo; respectively,
approach in pronunciation the sound of the English pronoun
&lsquo;she.&rsquo; This may have led to confusion in the mouths of
Highlanders who had but very imperfectly mastered English. In any case,
it is far too superficial to be quoted as a parallel to the <i>hi</i>,
&lsquo;she,&rsquo; in question in Welsh. A cautious Celtist, if such
there be, might warn us, before proceeding further with the search, to
make sure that the whole phenomenon is not a mere accident of Welsh
phonetics, and that it is not a case of two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb644" href="#pb644" name=
"pb644">644</a>]</span>pronouns, one meaning &lsquo;she&rsquo; and the
other &lsquo;it,&rsquo; being confounded as the result merely of
phonetic decay. The answer to that is, that the language knows nothing
of any neuter pronoun which could assume the form of the <i>hi</i>
which occupies us; and further, that in locutions where the legitimate
representative of the neuter might be expected, the pronoun used is a
different one, <i>ef</i>, <i>e</i>, meaning both &lsquo;he&rsquo; and
&lsquo;it,&rsquo; as in <i>&iuml;-e</i> for <i>&iuml;-ef</i>, &lsquo;it
is he, she, it <i>or</i> they,&rsquo; <i>nag-e</i>, &lsquo;not he, she,
it <i>or</i> they,&rsquo; <i>ef a allai</i> or <i>fe allai</i>,
&lsquo;perhaps, peradventure, <i>peut-&ecirc;tre</i>, <i>il est
possible</i>.&rsquo; The French sentence suggests the analogous
question, what was the original force of denotation of the
&lsquo;il&rsquo; in such sentences as &lsquo;il fait beau,&rsquo;
&lsquo;il pleut,&rsquo; and &lsquo;il neige&rsquo;? In such cases it
now denotes nobody in particular, but has it always been one of his
names? French historical grammar may be able, unaided, to dispose of
the attenuated fortunes of M. <i>Il</i>, but we have to look for help
to the student of myth and allied subjects to enable us to identify the
great &lsquo;she&rsquo; persistently eluding our search in the syntax
of the Welsh language. Only two feminine names suggest themselves to me
as in any way appropriate: one is <i>tynghed</i>, &lsquo;fate or
fortune,&rsquo; and the other is <i>D&ocirc;n</i>, mother of some of
the most nebulous personages in Celtic literature.</p>
<p>There is, however, no evidence to show that either of them is really
the &lsquo;she&rsquo; of whom we are in quest; but I have something to
say about both as illustrating the other side of the theme, how the
study of language may help mythology. This I have so far only
illustrated by a reference to the equation of <span class="trans"
title="Zeus"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span> with <i>Dyaus</i>
and their congeners. Within the range of Celtic legend the case is
similar with D&ocirc;n, who figures on Welsh ground, as I have hinted,
as mother of certain heroes of the oldest chapters of the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. For it is from her that Gwydion, the bard and
arch-magician, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb645" href="#pb645"
name="pb645">645</a>]</span>Gofannon the smith his brother, are called
sons of D&ocirc;n; and so in the case of Arianrhod, daughter of
D&ocirc;n, mother of &#7930;ew, and owner of the sea-laved castle of
Caer Arianrhod, not far distant from the prehistoric mound of Dinas
Din&#7931;e, near the western mouth of the Menai Straits, as already
mentioned in another chapter, p. 208 above. In Irish legend, we detect
D&ocirc;n under the Irish form of her name, <i>Danu</i> or <i>Donu</i>,
genitive <i>Danann</i> or <i>Donann</i>, and she is almost singular
there in always being styled a divinity. From her the great mythical
personages of Irish legend are called <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i>,
or &lsquo;the Goddess Danu&rsquo;s Tribes,&rsquo; and sometimes <i>Fir
D&eacute;a</i>, or &lsquo;the Men of the Divinity.&rsquo; The last
stage in the Welsh history of D&ocirc;n consists of her translation to
the skies, where the constellation of Cassiopeia is supposed to
constitute <i>&#7930;ys D&ocirc;n</i> or D&ocirc;n&rsquo;s Court, as
the Corona Borealis is identified with <i>Caer Arianrhod</i> or
&lsquo;the Castle of D&ocirc;n&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;; but, as was
perhaps fitting, the dimensions of both are reduced to comparative
littleness by <i>Caer Gwydion</i>, &lsquo;the Magician Gwydion&rsquo;s
Battlements,&rsquo; spread over the radiant expanse of the whole Milky
Way<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10166src" href="#xd26e10166" name=
"xd26e10166src">1</a>. Now the identification of this ancient goddess
Danu or D&ocirc;n as that in whom the oldest legends of the Irish
Goidels and the Welsh Goidels converge, has been the work not so much
of mythology as of the science of language; for it was the latter that
showed how to call back a little colouring into the vanishing
lineaments of this faded ancestral divinity<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10172src" href="#xd26e10172" name="xd26e10172src">2</a>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb646" href="#pb646" name=
"pb646">646</a>]</span></p>
<p>For my next illustration, namely <i>tynghed</i>, &lsquo;fate,&rsquo;
I would cite a passage from the opening of one of the most Celtic of
Welsh stories, that of Kulhwch and Olwen. Kulhwch&rsquo;s father, after
being for some time a widower, marries again, and conceals from his
second wife the fact that he has a son. She finds it out and lets her
husband know it; so he sends for his son Kulhwch, and the following is
the account of the son&rsquo;s interview with his stepmother, as given
in Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s translation, ii. 252:&mdash;&lsquo;His
stepmother said unto him, &ldquo;It were well for thee to have a wife,
and I have a daughter who is sought of every man of renown in the
world.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not of an age to wed,&rdquo; answered the
youth. Then said she unto him, &ldquo;I declare to thee, that it is thy
destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou obtain Olwen, the
daughter of Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr.&rdquo; And the youth blushed, and
the love of the maiden diffused itself through all his frame, although
he had never seen her. And his father inquired of him, &ldquo;What has
come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?&rdquo; &ldquo;My
stepmother has declared to me, that I shall never have a wife until I
obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb647" href="#pb647"
name="pb647">647</a>]</span>easy for thee,&rdquo; answered his father.
&ldquo;Arthur is thy cousin. Go, therefore, unto Arthur to cut thy
hair, and ask this of him as a boon.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The physical theory of love for an unknown lady at the first mention
of her name, and the allusion to the Celtic tonsure, will have
doubtless caught the reader&rsquo;s attention, but I only wish to speak
of the words which the translator has rendered, &lsquo;I declare to
thee, that it is thy destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou
obtain Olwen.&rsquo; More closely rendered, the original might be
translated thus: &lsquo;I swear thee a destiny that thy side touch not
a wife till thou obtain Olwen.&rsquo; The word in the Welsh for destiny
is <i>tynghet</i> (for an earlier <i>tuncet</i>), and the corresponding
Irish word is attested as <i>tocad</i>. Both these words have a
tendency, like &lsquo;fate,&rsquo; to be used mostly <i>in peiorem
partem</i>. Formerly, however, they might be freely used in an
auspicious sense likewise, as for instance in the woman&rsquo;s name
<i>Tunccetace</i>, on an early inscribed stone in Pembrokeshire. If her
name had been rendered into Latin she would have probably been called
<i lang="la">Fortunata</i>, as a namesake of good fortune. I render the
Welsh <i lang="cy">mi a tynghaf dynghet itt</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10265src" href="#xd26e10265" name="xd26e10265src">3</a> into
English, &lsquo;I swear thee a destiny&rsquo;; but, more literally
still, one might possibly render it &lsquo;I swear thee a
swearing,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;I swear thee an oath,&rsquo; meaning
&lsquo;I swear for thee an oath which will bind thee.&rsquo; The
stepmother, it is true, is not represented going through the form of
words, for what she said appears to have been a regular formula, just
like that of putting a person in Medieval Irish story under
<i>gessa</i> or bonds of magic; but an oath or form of imprecation was
once doubtless a dark reality behind this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb648" href="#pb648" name="pb648">648</a>]</span>formula. In the
southern part of my native county of Cardigan, the phrase in question
has been in use within the last thirty years, and the practice which it
denotes is still so well known as to be the subject of local stories. A
friend of mine, who is not yet fifty, vividly remembers listening to an
uncle of his relating how narrowly he once escaped having the oath
forced on him. He was in the hilly portion of the parish of
&#7930;anwenog, coming home across country in the dead of a
midsummer&rsquo;s night, when leaping over a fence he unexpectedly came
down close to a man actively engaged in sheep-stealing. The uncle
instantly took to his heels, while the thief pursued him with a knife.
If the thief had caught him, it is understood that he would have held
his knife at his throat and forced on him an oath of secrecy. I have
not been able to ascertain the wording of the oath, but all I can learn
goes to show that it was dreaded only less than death itself. In fact,
there are stories current of men who failed to recover from the effects
of the oath, but lingered and died in a comparatively short time. Since
I got the foregoing story I have made inquiries of others in South
Cardiganshire, and especially of a medical friend of mine, who speaks
chiefly as to his native parish of &#7930;angyn&#7931;o. I found that
the idea is perfectly familiar to him and my other informants; but,
strange to say, from nobody could I gather that the illness is
considered to result necessarily from the violent administration of the
<i>tynghed</i> to the victim, or from the latter&rsquo;s disregarding
the secrecy of it by disclosing to his friends the name of the
criminal. In fact, I cannot discover that any such secrecy is
emphasized so long as the criminal is not publicly brought before a
court of justice. Rather is it that the <i>tynghed</i> effects blindly
the ruin of the sworn man&rsquo;s health, regardless of his conduct. At
any rate, that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb649" href="#pb649"
name="pb649">649</a>]</span>the interpretation which I am forced to put
on what I have been told.</p>
<p>The phrase <i>tyngu tynghed</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10296src"
href="#xd26e10296" name="xd26e10296src">4</a>, intelligible still in
Wales, recalls another instance of the importance of the spoken word,
to wit, the Latin <i>fatum</i>. Nay, it seems to suggest that the
latter might have perhaps originally been part of some such a formula
as <i lang="la">alicui fatum fari</i>, &lsquo;to say one a
saying,&rsquo; in the pregnant sense of applying to him words of power.
This is all the more to the point, as it is well known how closely
Latin and Celtic are related to one another, and how every advance in
the study of those languages goes to add emphasis to their kinship.
From the kinship of the languages one may expect, to a certain extent,
a similarity of rites and customs, and one has not to go further for
this than the very story which I have cited. When Kulhwch&rsquo;s
father first married, he is said to have sought a <i lang="cy">gwreic
kynmwyt ac ef</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10338src" href=
"#xd26e10338" name="xd26e10338src">5</a>, which means &lsquo;a wife of
the same food with him.&rsquo; Thus the wedded wife was she, probably,
who ate with her husband, and we are reminded of the food ceremony
which constituted the aristocratic marriage in ancient Rome: it was
called <i>confarreatio</i>, and in the course of it an offering of
cake, called <i lang="la">farreum libum</i>, used to be made to
Jupiter. A great French student of antiquity, M. Fustel de Coulanges,
describes the ceremony thus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10351src" href=
"#xd26e10351" name="xd26e10351src">6</a>:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Les deux &eacute;poux, comme en Gr&egrave;ce, font <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb650" href="#pb650" name="pb650">650</a>]</span>un
sacrifice, versent la libation, prononcent quelques pri&egrave;res, et
mangent ensemble un g&acirc;teau de fleur de farine (<i lang="la">panis
farreus</i>).</span>&rsquo; Lastly, my attention has been directed to
the place given to bread in the stories of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach and
&#7930;yn Elfarch. For on turning back to pp. 3&ndash;6, 17&ndash;8,
28, the reader will find too much made of the bread to allow us to
suppose that it had no meaning in the courtship. The young farmer
having fallen in love at first sight with the lake maiden, it looks as
if he wished, by inducing her to share the bread he was eating, to go
forthwith through a form of marriage by a kind of confarreation that
committed her to a contract to be his wife without any tedious
delay.</p>
<p>To return to the Latin <i>fatum</i>, I would point out that the
Romans had a plurality of <i>fata</i>; but how far they were suggested
by the Greek <span class="trans" title="moirai"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&mu;&omicron;&#8150;&rho;&alpha;&iota;</span></span> is not
quite clear: nor is it known that the ancient Welsh had more than one
<i>tynghed</i>. In the case, however, of old Norse literature, we come
across the Fate there as one bearing a name which is perhaps cognate
with the Welsh <i>tynghed</i>. I allude to a female figure, called
&THORN;okk, who appears in the touching myth of Balder&rsquo;s death.
When Balder had fallen at the hands of Loki and H&ouml;&#273;r, his
mother Frigg asked who would like to earn her good will by going as her
messenger to treat with Hell for the release of Balder.
Herm&oacute;&#273;r the Swift, another of the sons of Woden, undertook
to set out on that journey on his father&rsquo;s charger Sleipnir. For
nine dreary nights he pursued his perilous course without interruption,
through glens dark and deep, till he came to the river called Yell,
when he was questioned as to his errand by the maid in charge of the
Yell bridge. On and on he rode afterwards till he came to the fence of
Hell&rsquo;s abode, which his horse cleared at full speed.
Herm&oacute;&#273;r entered the hall, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb651" href="#pb651" name="pb651">651</a>]</span>there found his
brother Balder seated in the place of honour. He abode with him that
night, and in the morning he asked Hell to let Balder ride home with
him to the Anses. He urged Hell to consider the grief which everybody
and everything felt for Balder. She replied that she would put that to
the test by letting Balder go if everything animate and inanimate would
weep for him; but he would be detained if anybody or anything declined
to do so. Herm&oacute;&#273;r made his way back alone to the Anses, and
announced to Frigg the answer which Hell had given to her request.
Messengers were sent forth without delay to bid all the world beweep
Woden&rsquo;s son out of the power of Hell. This was done accordingly
by all, by men and animals, by earth and stones, by trees and all
metals, &lsquo;as you have doubtless seen these things weep,&rsquo;
says the writer of the Prose Edda, &lsquo;when they pass from frost to
warmth.&rsquo; When the messengers, however, were on their way home,
after discharging their duty, they chanced on a cave where dwelt a
giantess called &THORN;okk, whom they ordered to join in the weeping
for Balder; but she only answered:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&THORN;okk will weep dry tears</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">At Balder&rsquo;s bale-fire.</p>
<p class="line">What is the son of man, quick or dead, to me!</p>
<p class="line xd26e394">Let Hell keep what she holds<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10401src" href="#xd26e10401" name="xd26e10401src">7</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In this ogress &THORN;okk, deaf to the appeals of the
tenderer feelings, we seem to have the counterpart of our Celtic
<i>tocad</i> and <i>tynghed</i>; and the latter&rsquo;s name as a part
of the formula in the Welsh story, while giving us the key of the myth,
shows how the early Aryan knew of nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb652" href="#pb652" name="pb652">652</a>]</span>more binding than the
magic force of an oath. On the one hand, this conception of destiny
carries with it the marks of its humble origin, and one readily agrees
with Cicero&rsquo;s words, <i lang="la">De Divinatione</i>, ii. 7, when
he says, <i lang="la">anile sane et plenum superstitionis fati nomen
ipsum</i>. On the other hand, it rises to the grim dignity of a name
for the dark, inexorable power which the whole universe is conceived to
obey, a power before which the great and resplendent <span class=
"trans" title="Zeus"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span> of the Aryan race is
a mere puppet.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have dwelt only too long on the policy of &lsquo;give and
take&rsquo; which ought to obtain between mythology and glottology.
Unfortunately, one can add without fear of contradiction, that, even
when that policy is carried out to the utmost, both sciences will still
have difficulties more than enough. In the case of mythology these
difficulties spring chiefly from two distinct sources, from the
blending of history with myth, and from the mixing of one race with
another. Let us now consider the latter: the difficulties from this
source are many and great, but every fresh acquisition of knowledge
tending to make our ideas of ethnology more accurate, gives us a better
leverage for placing the myths of mixed peoples in their proper places
as regards the races composing those peoples. Still, we have far fewer
propositions to lay down than questions to ask: thus to go no further
afield than the well-known stories attaching to the name of Heracles,
how many of them are Aryan, how many Semitic, and how many Aryan and
Semitic at one and the same time? That is the sort of question which
besets the student of Celtic mythology at every step; for the Celtic
nations of the present day are the mixed descendants of Aryan invaders
and the native populations which those Aryan invaders found in
possession. So the question thrusts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb653" href="#pb653" name="pb653">653</a>]</span>itself on the
student, to which of these races a particular myth, rite, or custom is
to be regarded as originally belonging. Take, for instance,
Br&acirc;n&rsquo;s colossal figure, to which attention has already been
called, pp. 552&ndash;3 above. Br&acirc;n was too large to enter a
house or go on board a ship: is he to be regarded as the outcome of
Celtic imagination, or of that of a people that preceded the Celts in
Celtic lands? The comparison with the Gaulish <i>Tricephal</i> would
seem to point in the direction of the southern seaboard of the Baltic
(p. 553): what then?</p>
<p>The same kind of question arises in reference to the Irish hero
C&uacute;chulainn: take, for instance, the stock description of
C&uacute;chulainn in a rage. Thus when angered he underwent strange
distortions: the calves of his legs came round to where his shins
should have been; his mouth enlarged itself so that it showed his liver
and lungs swinging in his throat; one of his eyes became as small as a
needle&rsquo;s, or else it sank back into his head further than a crane
could have reached, while the other protruded itself to a corresponding
length; every hair on his body became as sharp as a thorn, and held on
its point a drop of blood or a spark of fire. It would be dangerous
then to stop him from fighting, and even when he had fought enough, he
required for his cooling to be plunged into three baths of cold water;
the first into which he went would instantly boil over, the second
would be too hot for anybody else to bear, and the third only would be
of congenial warmth. I do not ask whether that strange picture betrays
a touch of the solar brush, but I should be very glad to know whether
it can be regarded as an Aryan creation or not.</p>
<p>It is much the same with matters other than mythological: take, for
instance, the bedlamite custom of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb654" href="#pb654" name="pb654">654</a>]</span>couvade<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10451src" href="#xd26e10451" name=
"xd26e10451src">8</a>, which is presented to us in Irish literature in
the singular form of a <i>cess</i>, &lsquo;suffering or
indisposition,&rsquo; simultaneously attacking the braves of ancient
Ulster. We are briefly informed in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
60<sup>a</sup>, that the women and boys of Ulster were free from it. So
was any Ultonian, we are told, who happened to be outside the
boundaries of his country, and so were C&uacute;chulainn and his
father, even when in Ulster. Any one who was rash enough to attack an
Ultonian warrior during this his period of helplessness could not, it
is further stated, expect to live afterwards either prosperously or
long. The question for us, however, is this: was the couvade introduced
by the Aryan invaders of Ireland, or are we rather to trace it to an
earlier race? I should be, I must confess, inclined to the latter view,
especially as the couvade was known among the Iberians of old, and
among the ancient Corsicans<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10476src" href=
"#xd26e10476" name="xd26e10476src">9</a>. It may, of course, have been
both Aryan and Iberian, but it will all the same serve as a specimen of
the sort of question which one has to try to answer. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb655" href="#pb655" name="pb655">655</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another instance, the race origin of which one would like to
ascertain, offers itself in the curious belief, that, when a child is
born, it is one of the ancestors of the family come back to live again.
Traces of this occur in Irish literature, namely, in one of the stories
about C&uacute;chulainn. There we read to the following
effect:&mdash;The Ultonians took counsel on account of
C&uacute;chulainn, because their wives and girls loved him greatly; for
C&uacute;chulainn had no consort at that time. This was their counsel,
namely, that they should seek for C&uacute;chulainn a consort pleasing
to him to woo. For it was evident to them that a man who has the
consort of his companionship with him would be so much the less likely
to attempt the ruin of their girls and to receive the affection of
their wives. Then, moreover, they were anxious and afraid lest the
death of C&uacute;chulainn should take place early, so they were
desirous for that reason to give him a wife in order that he might
leave an heir; for they knew that it was from himself that his rebirth
(<i>athgein</i>) would be. That is what one reads in the
eleventh-century copy of the ancient manuscript of the <i>Book of the
Dun Cow</i>, fo. 121<sup>b</sup>; and this atavistic belief, which was
touched upon in connexion with the transformations discussed in the
last chapter, I need scarcely say, is well known elsewhere to the
anthropologist, as one will find on consulting the opening pages of Dr.
Tylor&rsquo;s second volume on <i>Primitive Culture</i>. He there
mentions the idea as familiar to American Indians, to various African
peoples, to the Maoris and the aborigines of Australia, to Cheremiss
Tartars and Lapps. Among such nations the words of Don Di&egrave;gue to
his victorious son, the Cid, could hardly fail to be construed in a
sort of literal sense when he exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; ton illustre
audace</p>
<p class="line">Fait bien revivre en toi les h&eacute;ros de ma
race.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb656" href="#pb656" name=
"pb656">656</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us return to C&uacute;chulainn, and note the statement, that he
and his father, Sualdaim, were exempt from the couvade, which marks
them out as not of the same race as the Ultonians, that is to say, as
the <i>F&iacute;r Ulaid</i>, or &lsquo;True
Ultonians&rsquo;&mdash;presumably ancient inhabitants of Ulster.
Furthermore, we have an indication whence his family had come, for
C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s first name was <i>Setanta Beg</i>, &lsquo;the
Little Setantian,&rsquo; which points to the coast of what is now
Lancashire, as already indicated at p. 385 above. Another thing which
marks C&uacute;chulainn as of a different racial origin from the other
Ultonians is the belief of the latter, that his rebirth must be from
himself. The meaning of this remarkable statement is that there were
two social systems face to face in Ulster at the time represented by
the C&uacute;chulainn story, and that one of them recognized
fatherhood, while the other did not. Thus for C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s
rebirth to be from himself, he must be the father of a child from whom
should descend a man who would be a rebirth or avatar of
C&uacute;chulainn. The other system implied was one which reckoned
descent by birth alone<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10508src" href=
"#xd26e10508" name="xd26e10508src">10</a>; and the C&uacute;chulainn
story gives one the impression that it contemplated this system as the
predominant one, while the C&uacute;chulainn family, with its reckoning
of fatherhood, comes in as an exception. At all events, that is how I
now understand a passage, the full significance of which had till
recently escaped me.</p>
<p>Allusion has already been made to the story of C&uacute;chulainn
being himself a rebirth, namely, of Lug, and the story deserves still
further consideration in its bearing on the question of race, to which
the reader&rsquo;s attention has been called. It is needless, however,
to say that there are extant fragments of more stories than
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb657" href="#pb657" name=
"pb657">657</a>]</span>one as to C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s origin.
Sometimes, as in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fo. 119<sup>a</sup>, he
is called <i>gein Loga</i>, or Lug&rsquo;s offspring, and in the epic
tale of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; Cuailnge, Lug as his father comes
from the <i>S&iacute;d</i> or Faery to take C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s
place in the field, when the latter was worn out with sleeplessness and
toil. Lug sings over him <i>&eacute;li Loga</i>, or &lsquo;Lug&rsquo;s
enchantment,&rsquo; and C&uacute;chulainn gets the requisite rest and
sleep<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10535src" href="#xd26e10535" name=
"xd26e10535src">11</a>: this we read in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>,
fo. 78<sup>a</sup>. In another version of the story, C&uacute;chulainn
is an incarnation of Lug: the narrative relates how a foster-son was
accepted by Dechtere, sister to Conchobar MacNessa, king of Ulster. But
her foster-son died <span class="corr" id="xd26e10553" title=
"Source: youug">young</span>, to the great grief of Dechtere; and her
lamentations for him on the day of his funeral having made her thirsty,
she inadvertently swallowed with her drink a diminutive creature which
sprang into her mouth. That night she had a dream, in which a man
informed her that she was pregnant, that it was he who was in her womb,
that he had been her foster-son, and that he was Lug; also that when
his birth should take place, the name was to be Setanta. After an
incident which I can only regard as a clumsy attempt to combine the
more primitive legend with the story which makes him son of Sualdaim,
she gives birth to the boy, and he is duly called Setanta<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10556src" href="#xd26e10556" name=
"xd26e10556src">12</a>: that was C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s first name.
Now compare this with what Dr. Tylor mentions in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb658" href="#pb658" name="pb658">658</a>]</span>the
case of the Lapps, namely, that &lsquo;the future mother was told in a
dream what name to give her child, this message being usually given her
by the very spirit of the deceased ancestor, who was about to be
incarnate in her<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10577src" href=
"#xd26e10577" name="xd26e10577src">13</a>.&rsquo; If the mother got no
such intimation in a dream, the relatives of the child had to have
recourse to magic and the aid of the wise man, to discover the name to
be given to the child.</p>
<p>Here let it suffice to say, that the similarity is so close between
the Irish and the Lapp idea, and so unlike anything known to have been
Aryan, that it is well worth bearing in mind. The belief in rebirth
generally seems to fit as a part of the larger belief in the
transmigration of souls which is associated with the teachings of the
ancient druids, a class of shamans or medicine-men who were probably,
as already hinted, not of Celtic or Aryan origin; and probably the
beliefs here in question were those of some non-Aryan people of these
islands, rather than of any Aryans who settled in them. This view need
hardly be regarded as incompatible with the fact, that Lug&rsquo;s
name, genitive <i>Loga</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb659" href=
"#pb659" name="pb659">659</a>]</span>would seem to have meant light,
and that Lug was a sun-god, very possibly a Celtic sun-god: or more
correctly speaking, that there was a series of Lugs, so to say, or
sun-gods, called in ancient Spain, Switzerland, and on the banks of the
Rhine, <i>Lugoves</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10616src" href=
"#xd26e10616" name="xd26e10616src">14</a>. For one is sorely tempted to
treat this much as a rescue from the wreckage of the solar myth theory,
as against those who, having regard mainly to Lug&rsquo;s professional
skill and craft as described in Irish story, make of him a kind of
Hermes or Mercury. In other words, we have either to regard a Celtic
Lug as having become the centre of certain non-Celtic legends, or else
to suppose neither Lug nor his name to be of Aryan origin at all. It is
hard to say which is the sounder view to take.</p>
<p>The next question which I wish to suggest is as to the ethnology of
the fairies; but before coming to that, one has to ask how the fairies
have been evolved. The idea of fairies, such as Welshmen have been
familiar with from their childhood, clearly involves elements of two
distinct origins. Some of those elements come undoubtedly from the
workshop of the imagination, as, for example, the stock notion that
their food and drink are brought to the fairies by the mere force of
wishing, and without the ministration of servants; or the notion,
especially prevalent in Arfon, that the fairies dwell in a country
beneath the lakes of Snowdon; not to mention the more general connexion
of a certain class of fairies with the world of waters, as indicated in
chapter vii. Add to this that the dead ancestor has also probably
contributed to our bundle of notions about them; but that contains also
an element of fact or something which may at any rate be conceived as
historical. Under this head I should place <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb660" href="#pb660" name="pb660">660</a>]</span>the
following articles of faith concerning them: the sallowness of their
skins and the smallness of their stature, their dwelling underground,
their dislike of iron, and the comparative poverty of their homes in
the matter of useful articles of furniture, their deep-rooted objection
to the green sward being broken up by the plough, the success of the
fairy wife in attending to the domestic animals and to the dairy, the
limited range generally of the fairies&rsquo; ability to count; and
lastly, one may perhaps mention their using a language of their own (p.
279), which would imply a time when the little people understood no
other, and explain why they should be represented doing their marketing
without uttering a syllable to anybody (p. 161).</p>
<p>The attribution of these and similar characteristics to the fairies
can scarcely be all mere feats of fancy and imagination: rather do they
seem to be the result of our ancestors projecting on an imaginary world
a primitive civilization through which tradition represented their own
race as having passed, or, more probably, a civilization in which they
saw, or thought they saw, another race actually living. Let us recur
for examples also to the two lake legends which have just been
mentioned (p. 650): in both of them a distinction is drawn between the
lake fairy&rsquo;s notion of bread and that of the men and women of the
country. To the fairy the latter&rsquo;s bread appeared crimped or
overbaked: possibly the backward civilization, to which she was
supposed to belong, was content to support itself on some kind of
unleavened bread, if not rather on a fare which included nothing
deserving to be called bread at all. Witness Giraldus Cambrensis&rsquo;
story of Eliodorus, in which bread is conspicuous by its absence, the
nearest approach to it being something of the consistency of porridge:
see p. 270 above. Then take another order of ideas: the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb661" href="#pb661" name=
"pb661">661</a>]</span>young man in both lake legends lives with his
mother (pp. 3, 27): there is no father to advise or protect him: he is
in this respect on a level with Undine, who is the protegee of her
tiresome uncle, K&uuml;hleborn. Seemingly, he belongs to a primitive
society where matriarchal ideas rule, and where paternity is not
reckoned<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10633src" href="#xd26e10633" name=
"xd26e10633src">15</a>. This we are at liberty at all events to suppose
to have been the original, before the narrator had painted the mother a
widow, and given the picture other touches of his later brush.</p>
<p>To speak, however, of paternity as merely not reckoned is by no
means to go far enough; so here we have to return to take another look
at the imaginary aspect of the fairies, to which a cursory allusion has
just been made. The reader will possibly recall the sturdy smith of
Ystrad Meurig, who would not reduce the notions which he had formed of
the fairies when he was a child to conformity with those of a later
generation around him. In any case, he will remember the smith&rsquo;s
statement that <i>the fairies were all women</i>: see p. 245. The idea
was already familiar to me as a Welshman, though I cannot recollect how
I got it. But the smith&rsquo;s words brought to my mind at once the
story of Condla R&uacute;ad or the Red, one of the fairy tales first
recorded in Irish literature (p. 291). There the damsel who takes
Condla away in her boat of glass to the realm of the Everliving sings
the praises of that delectable country, and uses, among others, the
following words, which occur in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
120:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ni fil cenel and namm&aacute; acht mn&aacute; ocus
ingena<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10652src" href="#xd26e10652" name=
"xd26e10652src">16</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">There is no race there but women and maidens alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb662" href="#pb662" name=
"pb662">662</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now what people could have come by the idea of a race of women only?
Surely no people who considered that they themselves had fathers: it
must have been some community so low in the scale of civilization as
never to have had any notion whatsoever of paternity: it is their
ignorance that would alone render possible the notion of a race all
women. That this was a matter of belief in the past of many nations, is
proved by the occurrence of widely known legends about virgin
mothers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10689src" href="#xd26e10689" name=
"xd26e10689src">17</a>; not to mention that it has been lately
established, that there are savages who to this day occupy the low
place here indicated in the scale of civilization. Witness the evidence
of Spencer and Gillen in their recently published work on <i>The Native
Tribes of Central Australia</i>, and also what Frazer, author of <i>The
Golden Bough</i>, says of a passage in point, in the former, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus, in the opinion of these savages, every conception is
what we are wont to call an immaculate conception, being brought about
by the entrance into the mother of a spirit apart from any contact with
the other sex. Students of folklore have long been familiar with
notions of this sort occurring in the stories of the birth of
miraculous personages, but this is the first case on record of a tribe
who believe in immaculate conception as the sole cause of the birth of
every human being who comes into the world. A people so ignorant of the
most elementary of natural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb663" href=
"#pb663" name="pb663">663</a>]</span>processes may well rank at the
very bottom of the savage scale<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10708src"
href="#xd26e10708" name="xd26e10708src">18</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is to some population in that low position, in the
remote prehistory of this country, that one is to trace the belief that
the fairies were all women. It is to be regarded as a position
distinctly lower than that of the Ultonians in the time of
C&uacute;chulainn; for the couvade seems to me to argue a notion of
paternity&mdash;perhaps, in their case, as clear a notion of paternity
as was possible for a community which was not quite out of the
promiscuous stage of society.</p>
<p>The neo-Celtic nations of these islands consist, speaking roughly,
of a mixture of the invading Celts with the earlier inhabitants whom
the Celts found in possession. These two or more groups of peoples may
have been in very different stages of civilization when they first came
in contact with one another. They agreed doubtless in many things, and
perhaps, among others, in cherishing an inherited reluctance to
disclose their names, but the Celts as Aryans were never without the
decimal system of counting. Like the French, the Celtic nations of the
present day show a tendency, more or less marked, to go further and
count by scores instead of by tens. But the Welsh are alone among them
in having, in certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb664" href=
"#pb664" name="pb664">664</a>]</span>instances, gone back from counting
by tens to counting by fives, which they do when they count between 10
and 20: for 16, 17, 18, and 19 are in Welsh 1 on 15, 2 on 15, 3 on 15,
and 4 on 15 respectively; and similarly with 13 and 14<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10720src" href="#xd26e10720" name=
"xd26e10720src">19</a>. We have seen how the lake fairy reckoned by
fives (pp. 8, 418) all the live stock she was to have as her dowry; and
one otherwise notices that the fairies deal invariably in the simplest
of numbers. Thus if you wish, for example, to find a person who has
been led away by them, ten to one you have to go &lsquo;this day next
year&rsquo; to the spot where he disappeared. Except in the case of the
alluring light of the full moon, it is out of the question to reckon
months or weeks, though it is needless to say that to reckon the year
correctly would have been in point of fact far more difficult; but
nothing sounds simpler than &lsquo;this day next year.&rsquo; In that
simple arithmetic of the fairies, then, we seem to have a trace of a
non-Aryan race, that is to say, probably of some early inhabitants of
these islands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the language of those inhabitants has died out, so
that we cannot appeal to its numerals directly; and the next best
course to adopt is to take as a sort of substitute for their language
that of possible kinsmen of a pre-Celtic race in this country. Now the
students of ethnology, especially those devoted to the investigation of
skulls and skins, tell us that we have among us, notably in Wales and
Ireland, living representatives of a dark-haired, long-skulled race of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb665" href="#pb665" name=
"pb665">665</a>]</span>same description as one of the types which
occur, as they allege, among the Basque populations of the Pyrenees. We
turn accordingly to Basque, and what do we find? Why, that the first
five numerals in that language are <i>bat</i>, <i>bi</i>, <i>iru</i>,
<i>lau</i>, <i>bost</i>, all of which appear to be native; but when we
come to the sixth numeral we have <i>sei</i>, which looks like an Aryan
word borrowed from Latin, Gaulish, or some related tongue. The case is
much the same with &lsquo;seven,&rsquo; for that is in Basque
<i>zazpi</i>, which is also probably an Aryan loan-word. Basque has
native words, <i>zortzi</i> and <i>bederatzi</i>, for eight and nine,
but they are longer than the first five, and appear to be of a later
formation affecting, in common with <i>sei</i> and <i>zazpi</i>, the
termination <i>i</i>. I submit, therefore, that here we have evidence
of the former existence of a people in the West of Europe who at one
time only counted as far as five. Some of the early peoples of the
British Isles may have been on the same level, so that our notions
about the fairies have probably been derived, to a greater or less
extent, from ideas formed by the Celts concerning those non-Celtic,
non-Aryan natives of whose country they took possession.</p>
<p>As regards my appeal to the authority of craniology, I have to
confess that it is made with a certain amount of reservation, since the
case is far less simple than it looks at first sight. Thus, in August,
1891, the Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological Association, including among
them Professor Sayce, visited the south-west of Ireland. During our
pleasant excursions in Kerry, the question of race was one of our
constant topics; and Professor Sayce was reminded by what he saw in
Ireland of his visit to North Africa, especially the hilly regions of
the country inhabited by the Berbers. Among other things, he used to
say that if a number of Berbers from the mountains were to be brought
to an Irish village and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb666" href=
"#pb666" name="pb666">666</a>]</span>clad as Irishmen, he felt positive
that he should not be able to tell them from the Irishmen themselves,
such as we saw on our rambles in Kerry. This struck me as all the more
remarkable, since his reference was to fairly tall, blue-eyed men whose
hair could not be called black. On the other hand, owing perhaps to
ignorance and careless ways of looking at things around me, I am a
little sceptical as to the swarthy long-skulls: they did not seem to
meet us at every turn in Ireland; and as for Wales, which I know as
well as most people do, I cannot in my ignorance of craniology say with
any confidence that I have ever noticed vast numbers of that type. I
should like, however, to see the heads of some of the singers whom I
have noticed at our Eiste&#273;fodau at Cardiff, Aberdare, and Swansea,
placed under the hands of an experienced skull-man. For I have long
suspected that we cannot regard as of Aryan origin the vocal talent so
general in Wales, and so conspicuous in our choirs of working people as
to astonish all the great musicians who have visited our national
festival. Beyond all doubt, race has not a little to do with the
artistic feelings: a short-skull may be as unmusical, for example, as I
am; but has anybody in this country ever known a narrow long-skull to
be the reverse of unmusical? or has any one ever considered how few
clergymen of the tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed type have been converted
to the ritualistic and &aelig;sthetic movement in the Church of
England?</p>
<p>As it seems to me that the bulk of the Welsh people would have to be
described as short-skulls, it would be very gratifying to see those who
are wont to refer freely to the dark-complexioned long-skulls of Wales
catch a respectable number of specimens. I trust there are plenty to be
found; and of course I do not care how they are taken, whether it be by
an instantaneous process <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb667" href=
"#pb667" name="pb667">667</a>]</span>of photography or in the meshes of
some anthropometric sportsman, like Dr. Beddoe. Let them be secured
anyhow, so that one may rest assured that the type is still numerically
safe, and be able to judge with one&rsquo;s own eyes how heads long and
swarthy look on the shoulders of living Welshmen. We might then be in a
position also to compare with them the prevalent description of fairy
changelings; for when the fairies steal nice, blond babies, they
usually place in their stead their own aged-looking brats with short
legs, sallow skins, and squeaky voices. Unfortunately for me, all the
adult changelings of whom I happen to have heard any account had died
some years before I began to turn my attention to the population of
Faery, with the exception, perhaps, of one whose name I obtained under
the seal of secrecy. It was that of the wife of a farmer living near
Nefyn, in West Carnarvonshire. It was whispered that she was a
changeling, so I am inclined to regard her as no other than one of the
representatives of the same aboriginal stock to which one might
conjecture some of her neighbours also to belong; she ought to be an
extreme specimen of the type. It is to be hoped that the photographer
and his anthropometric brother have found her out in time and in good
humour; but it is now many years since I heard of her.</p>
<p>To return again to the fairies, some of them are described as more
comely and good-looking than the rest (pp. 83, 250), but the fairy
women are always pictured as fascinating, though their offspring as
changelings are as uniformly presented in the light of repulsive
urchins; but whole groups of the fairy population are sometimes
described as being as ugly of face as they were thievish in
disposition&mdash;those, for instance, of &#7930;anfabon, in
Glamorganshire (p. 262). There is one district, however, which is an
exception to the tenor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb668" href=
"#pb668" name="pb668">668</a>]</span>of fairy physiognomy: it is that
of the Pennant neighbourhood, in Carnarvonshire, together with the
hills and valleys, roughly speaking, from Cwm Stra&#7931;yn to
&#7930;wytmor and from Drws y Coed to Dolbenmaen. The fairies of that
tract are said to have been taller than the others, and characterized
by light or even flaxen hair, together with eyes of clear blue: see pp.
89, 93&ndash;7, 105&ndash;8. Nor is that all, for we are told that they
would not let a person of dark complexion come near them (p. 96). The
other fairies, when kidnapping, it is true, preferred the blond infants
of other people to their own swarthy brats, which, perhaps, means that
it was a policy of their people to recruit itself with men of the
superior physique of the more powerful population around them. The
supposed fairy ancestress of the people of the Pennant Valley bears, in
the stories in point, such names as Penelope, Bella, Pelisha, and Sibi,
while her descendants are still taunted with their descent&mdash;a
quarrel which, within living memory, used to be fought out with fists
at the fairs at Penmorfa and elsewhere. This seems to indicate a
comparatively late settlement<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10790src"
href="#xd26e10790" name="xd26e10790src">20</a> in the district of a
family or group of families from without, and an origin, therefore,
somewhat similar to that of the <i>Simychiaid</i> and <i>Cowperiaid</i>
(p. 67) of a more eastern portion of the same county, rather than
anything deserving to be considered with the rest of the annals of
Faery. Passing by this oasis, then, such snap-shot photographs as I
have been able to take, so to speak, of fairyland cleared of the
glamour resting on its landscape, seem to disclose to the eye a swarthy
population of short stumpy men occupying the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb669" href="#pb669" name="pb669">669</a>]</span>most
inaccessible districts of our country. They appear to have cared more
for soap than clothing<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10805src" href=
"#xd26e10805" name="xd26e10805src">21</a>, and they lived on milk taken
once a day, when they could get it. They probably fished and hunted,
and kept domestic animals, including, perhaps, the pig; but they
depended largely on what they could steal at night or in misty weather.
Their thieving, however, was not resented, as their visits were
believed to bring luck and prosperity (p. 251). Their communities
formed as it were islands, owing to the country round about them having
been wrested from them by later comers of a more warlike disposition
and provided with better weapons. But the existence of the scattered
groups of the fairies was in no danger of coming to a violent end: they
were safe in consequence of the superstitious beliefs of their stronger
neighbours, who probably regarded them as formidable magicians,
powerful, among other things, to cause or to cure disease as they
pleased. Such, without venturing to refresh my memory by perusing what
has been written about dwarf races in other parts of the world, are the
impressions made on my mind in the course of analysing and sifting the
folklore materials crowded into this volume. That applies, of course,
in so far only as regards the fairies in their character of a real
people as distinguished from them as creatures of the imagination. But,
as I have no wish to earn the displeasure of my literary friends, let
me hasten to say that I acknowledge the latter, the creatures of the
imagination, to be the true fairies, the admiration of one&rsquo;s
childhood and the despair of one&rsquo;s later years: the other
folk&mdash;the aborigines whom I have been trying to depict&mdash;form
only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb670" href="#pb670" name=
"pb670">670</a>]</span>a sort of substratum, a kind of background to
the fairy picture, which I should be the last man to wish to mar.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that we have no trace of any fairies
approaching the minute dimensions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Queen Mab;
for, after all, our fairies are mostly represented as not extravagantly
unlike other people in personal appearance&mdash;not so unlike, in
fact, that other folk might not be mistaken for them now and then as
late as the latter part of the fifteenth century. Witness the following
passage from Sir John Wynne&rsquo;s <i>History of the Gwydir
Family</i>, p. 74:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haveing purchased this lease, he removed his dwelling to the
castle of Dolwy&#273;elan, which at that time was in part thereof
habitable, where one Howell ap Jevan ap Rys Gethin, in the beginning of
Edward the Fourth his raigne, captaine of the countrey and an outlaw,
had dwelt. Against this man David ap Jenkin rose, and contended with
him for the sovreignety of the countrey; and being superiour to him, in
the end he drew a draught for him, and took him in his bed at Penanmen
with his concubine, performing by craft, what he could not by force,
and brought him to Conway Castle. Thus, after many bickerings betweene
Howell and David ap Jenkin, he being too weake, was faigne to flie the
countrey, and to goe to Ireland, where he was a yeare or thereabouts.
In the end he returned in the summer time, haveing himselfe, and all
his followers clad in greene, who, being come into the countrey, he
dispersed here and there among his friends, lurking by day, and
walkeing in the night for feare of his adversaries; and such of the
countrey as happened to have a sight of him and his followers, said
they were the fairies, and soe ran away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But what has doubtless helped, above all other things, to perpetuate
the belief in the existence of fairies may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb671" href="#pb671" name="pb671">671</a>]</span>be
said to be the popular association with them of the circles in the
grass, commonly known in English as fairy rings. This phenomenon must
have answered for ages the purpose for our ancestors, practically
speaking, of ocular demonstration, as it still does no doubt in many a
rustic neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The most common name for the fairies in Welsh is <i>y Tylwyth
Teg</i>, &lsquo;the Fair or Beautiful Family&rsquo;; but in South
Cardiganshire we have found them called <i>Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>,
&lsquo;the Children of Rhys the Deep&rsquo; (pp. 151, 158), while in
Gwent and Morgannwg they are more usually known as <i lang="cy">Bendith
y Mamau</i>, &lsquo;the Blessing of the Mothers&rsquo; (p. 174). Our
fourteenth century poet, D. ab Gwilym, uses the first-mentioned term,
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, in poem xxxix, and our prose literature
has a word <i>corr</i>, <i>cor</i> in the sense of a dwarf, and
<i>corres</i> for a she dwarf. The old Cornish had also <i>cor</i>,
which in Breton is written <i>korr</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10850src" href="#xd26e10850" name="xd26e10850src">22</a>, with a
feminine <i>korrez</i>, and among the other derivatives one finds
<i>korrik</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf, a fairy, a wee little sorcerer,&rsquo;
and <i>korrigez</i> or <i>korrigan</i>, &lsquo;a she dwarf, a fairy
woman, a diminutive sorceress.&rsquo; The use of these words in Breton
recalls the case of the <i>cor</i>, called Rhu&#273;lwm or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb672" href="#pb672" name="pb672">672</a>]</span>else
Ei&#273;ilig, teaching his magic to Co&#7931;, son of Co&#7931;frewi:
see pp. 326, 503, 505. Then we have uncanny dwarfs in the romances,
such, for example, as the rude <i>cor</i> in the service of Edern ab
Nu&#273;, as described in French in Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s romance of
<i>Erec et Enide</i> and in Welsh in that of <i>Gereint vab Erbin</i>,
also the <i>cor</i> and <i>corres</i> who figure in the story of
Peredur. The latter had belonged to that hero&rsquo;s father and mother
till the break-up of the family, when the dwarfs went to Arthur&rsquo;s
Court, where they lived a whole year without speaking to anybody. When,
however, Peredur made his rustic appearance there, they hailed him
loudly as the chief of warriors and the flower of knighthood, which
brought on them the wrath of Cai, on whom they were eventually avenged
by Peredur. In the case<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10953src" href=
"#xd26e10953" name="xd26e10953src">23</a> of both Edern and Peredur we
find the dwarfs loyally interested in the fortunes of their masters and
their masters&rsquo; friends. With them also the shape-shifting Menw,
though not found placed in the same unfavourable light, is probably to
be ranged, as one may gather from his name and his r&ocirc;le of wizard
scout for Arthur&rsquo;s men (p. 510). In the like attachment on the
part of the fairies, which was at times liable to develop into
devotedness of an embarrassing nature (p. 250), we seem to have one of
the germs of the idea of a household fairy or <i>banshee</i>, as
illustrated by the case of the ugly wee woman in the Pantannas legend
(p. 188); and it seems natural to regard the interested voices in the
Kenfig legend, and other stories of the same kind (p. 452), as
instances of amalgamating the idea of a fairy with that of an ancestral
person.</p>
<p>At all events, we have obtained something to put by the side of the
instances already noticed of the fairy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb673" href="#pb673" name="pb673">673</a>]</span>girl who gives,
against her will at first, her services in the dairy of her captor (pp.
45, 87); of the other fairy who acts as a nurse for a family in the
Pennant Valley, till she is asked to dress better (p. 109); and of
Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn who works willingly and well, both at the house and
in the field, till he has tricks played on him (pp. 593&ndash;6). To
make this brief survey complete, one has to mention the fairies who
used to help Eilian with her spinning (pp. 211&ndash;3), and not to
omit those who were found to come to the rescue of a woman in despair
and to assist her on the condition of getting her baby. The motive here
is probably not to be confounded with that of the fairies who
stealthily exchanged babies: the explanation seems in this case to be
that the fairies, or some of the fairies, were once regarded as
cannibals, which is countenanced by such a story as that of Canrig Bwt,
&lsquo;Canrig the Stumpy.&rsquo; At &#7930;anberis the latter is said
to have lived beneath the huge stone called <i>y Gromlech</i>,
&lsquo;the Dolmen,&rsquo; opposite Cwmglas and near the high-road to
the Pass. When the man destined to dispatch her came, she was just
finishing her dinner off a baby&rsquo;s flesh. There are traces of a
similar story in another district, for a writer who published in the
year 1802 uses the following words:&mdash;&lsquo;There was lately near
Cerrig y Drudion, in Merionethshire, a subterraneous room composed of
large stones, which was called <i>Carchar Cynric Rwth</i>, i. e.
&ldquo;The Prison of Cynric Rwth,&rdquo; which has been taken notice of
by travellers.&rsquo; Cynric Rwth may be rendered &lsquo;Cynric the
Greedy or Broad-mouthed.&rsquo; A somewhat similar ogress is located by
another story on the high ground at Bwlch y Rhiw Felen, on the way from
&#7930;ango&#7931;en to &#7930;andegla, and she is represented by the
local tradition as contemporary with Arthur<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10978src" href="#xd26e10978" name="xd26e10978src">24</a>. I am
inclined to think the Cwmglas cromlech <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb674" href="#pb674" name="pb674">674</a>]</span>natural rather than
artificial; but I am, however, struck by the fact that the fairies are
not unfrequently located on or near ancient sites, such as seem to be
Corwrion (pp. 57, 526), the margin of &#7930;yn Ir&#273;yn (pp. 148,
563), Bryn y Pibion (pp. 212&ndash;4), Din&#7931;aen (p. 227), Carn
Bod&uuml;an (p. 227), on which there are, I am told, walls and hut
foundations similar to those which I have recently seen on Carn Fadrun
in the same district, Moe&#273;in camp (p. 245), and, perhaps, Ynys
Geinon Rock and the immediate vicinity of Craig y Nos, neither of
which, however, have I ever visited (p. 254). Local acquaintance with
each fairy centre would very possibly enable one to produce a list that
would be suggestive.</p>
<p>In passing one may point out that the uncanny dwarf of Celtic story
would seem to have served, in one way or another, as a model for other
dwarfs in the French romances and the literatures of other nations that
came under the influence of those romances, such as that of the
English. But the subject is too large to be dealt with here; so I
return to the word <i>cor</i>, in order to recall to the reader&rsquo;s
mind the allusion made, at p. 196, to a certain people called
<i>Coranneit</i> or <i>Coranyeit</i>, pronounced in later Welsh
<i>Cor&aacute;ni&#815;aid</i>, &lsquo;Corannians.&rsquo; They come in
the Adventure of &#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys, and there they
have ascribed to them one of the characteristics of consummate
magicians, namely, the power of hearing any word that comes in contact
with the wind; so it was, we are told, impossible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb675" href="#pb675" name="pb675">675</a>]</span>to
harm them. &#7930;&ucirc;&#273;, however, was advised to circumvent
them in the following manner:&mdash;he was to bruise certain insects in
water and sprinkle the water on the Corannians and his own people
indiscriminately, after calling them together under the pretence of
making peace between them; for the sprinkling would do no harm to his
own subjects, while it would kill the others. This unholy water proved
effective, and the Corannians all perished. Now the magic power
ascribed to them, and the method of disposing of them, combine to lend
them a fabulous aspect, while their name, inseparable as it seems from
<i>cor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo; warrants us in treating them as
fairies, and in regarding their strange characteristics as induced on a
real people. If we take this view, that <i>Coraniaid</i> was the name
of a real people, we are at liberty to regard it as possible, that
their name suggested to the Celts the word <i>cor</i> for a dwarf,
rather than that <i>cor</i> has suggested the name of the Corannians.
In either case, I may mention that Welsh writers have sometimes
thought&mdash;and they are probably right&mdash;that we have a closely
related word in the name of Ptolemy&rsquo;s <i>Coritani</i> or
<i>Coritavi</i>. He represents the people so called as dwelling,
roughly speaking, between the Trent and Norfolk, and possessed of the
two towns of <i>Lindum</i>, &lsquo;Lincoln,&rsquo; and
<i>Rat&aelig;</i> (p. 547), supposed to have been Leicester. There we
should have accordingly to suppose the old race to have survived so
long and in such numbers, that the Celtic lords of southern Britain
called the people of that area by a name meaning dwarfs. There also
they may be conjectured to have had quiet from invaders from the
Continent, because of the inaccessible nature of the fens, and the lack
of inviting harbours on the coast from the country of the Iceni up to
the neighbourhood of the Humber. How far their territory extended
inland from the fens and the sea one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb676" href="#pb676" name="pb676">676</a>]</span>cannot say, but it
possibly took in one-half of what is now Northamptonshire, with the
place called <i>Pytchley</i>, from an older <i>Pihtes L&eacute;a</i>,
meaning the Meadow of the Pict, or else of a man named Pict. In any
case it included Croyland in the fens between Peterborough and the
Wash. It was there, towards the end of the seventh century, that St.
Guthlac built his cell on the side of an ancient mound or tumulus, and
it was there he was assailed by demons who spoke <i>Bryttisc</i> or
Brythonic, a language which the saint knew, as he had been an exile
among Brythons. For this he had probably not to travel far; and it is
remarkable that his father&rsquo;s <i>cognomen</i> or surname was
<i>Penwall</i>, which we may regard as approximately the Brythonic for
&lsquo;Wall&rsquo;s End.&rsquo; That is to say, he was &lsquo;So-and-so
of the Wall&rsquo;s End,&rsquo; and had got to be known by the latter
designation instead of his own <i>nomen</i>, which is not recorded, for
the reason, possibly, that it was so Brythonic as not to admit of being
readily reduced into an Anglian or Latin form. It is not quite certain
that he belonged to the royal race of Mercia, whose genealogy, however,
boasts such un-English names as Pybba, Penda, and Peada; but the
life<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11060src" href="#xd26e11060" name=
"xd26e11060src">25</a> states, with no little emphasis, that he was a
man whose pedigree included the most noble names of illustrious kings
from the ancient stock of Icel: that is, he was one of the
<i>Iclingas</i> or Icklings<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11069src" href=
"#xd26e11069" name="xd26e11069src">26</a>. Here one is tempted to
perpetrate a little glottologic alchemy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb677" href="#pb677" name="pb677">677</a>]</span>by changing <i>l</i>
into <i>n</i>, and to suppose <i>Iclingas</i> the form taken in English
by the name of the ancient people of the <i>Iceni</i>. In any case,
nothing could be more reasonable to suppose than that some
representatives of the royal race of Prasutagus and Boudicca, escaping
the sword of the Roman, found refuge among the Coritanians at the time
of the final defeat of their own people: it is even possible that they
were already the ruling family there. At all events several indications
converge to show that communities speaking Brythonic were not far off,
to wit, the <i>p</i> names in the Mercian genealogy, Guthlac&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s surname, Guthlac&rsquo;s exile among Brythons, and the
attack on him at Croyland by Brythonic speaking foes. Portions of the
Coritanian territory were eminently fitted by nature to serve as a
refuge for a broken people with a belated language: witness as late as
the eleventh century the stand made in the Isle of Ely by Hereward
against the Norman conqueror and his mail-clad knights<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e11110src" href="#xd26e11110" name=
"xd26e11110src">27</a>.</p>
<p>Among the speakers of Goidelic in Ireland and the Highlands of
Scotland the fairies take their designation chiefly from a word
<i>s&iacute;d</i> or <i>s&iacute;th</i> (genitive <i>s&iacute;de</i> or
<i>s&iacute;da</i>), which one may possibly consider as of a common
origin with the Latin word <i>s&#275;des</i>, and as originally meaning
a seat or settlement, but it sooner or later came to signify simply an
abode of the fairies, whence they were called in Medieval Irish <i>aes
s&iacute;de</i>, &lsquo;fairy folk,&rsquo; <i>fer s&iacute;de</i>,
&lsquo;a fairy man,&rsquo; and <i>ben s&iacute;de</i>, &lsquo;a fairy
woman or <i>banshee</i>.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb678"
href="#pb678" name="pb678">678</a>]</span>By the side of
<i>s&iacute;d</i>, an adjective <i>s&iacute;de</i>, &lsquo;of or
belonging to the <i>s&iacute;d</i>,&rsquo; appears to have been formed,
so that they are found also called simply <i>s&iacute;de</i>, as in
Fiacc&rsquo;s Hymn, where we are told that before the advent of St.
Patrick the pagan tribes of Erin used to worship <i>s&iacute;de</i> or
fairies<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11164src" href="#xd26e11164" name=

imprisonments, including that of Arthur in Caer Oeth and Anoeth (p.
619), are mentioned also in the Triads: see i. 50, ii. 7, 49, iii. 61.
It is not improbable that the legend about Gwair located his prison on
Lundy, as the Welsh name of that island appears to have been <i>Ynys
Wair</i>, &lsquo;Gwair&rsquo;s Isle.&rsquo; Pwy&#7931; and Pryderi did
not belong to Annwn, nor did Pryderi&rsquo;s friend Manawy&#273;an; but
the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Pwy&#7931; relates how for a whole year
Pwy&#7931; exchanged crown and kingdom with Arawn king of Annwn, from
whom he obtained the first breed of domestic pigs for his own people
(pp. 69, 525).</p>
<p>In the lowlands of Scotland, together with the Orkneys and
Shetlands, the Picts have to a certain extent taken the place of our
fairies, and they are colloquially called Pechts. Now judging from the
remains there ascribed to the Pechts, their habitations were either
wholly underground or else so covered over with stones and earth and
grass as to look like natural hillocks and to avoid attracting the
attention of strangers. This was helped by making the entrance very low
and as inconspicuous as possible. But one of the most remarkable things
about these <i>s&iacute;ds</i> is that the cells within them are
frequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb680" href="#pb680" name=
"pb680">680</a>]</span>so small as to prove beyond doubt, that those
who inhabited them were of a remarkably short stature, though it is
demonstrated by the weight of the stones used, that the builders were
not at all lacking in bodily strength<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11314src" href="#xd26e11314" name="xd26e11314src">31</a>. Here we
have, accordingly, a small people like our own fairies. In Ireland one
of the most famous kings of the fairies was called Mider of Br&iacute;
L&eacute;ith, where he resided in a <i>s&iacute;d</i> or mound in the
neighbourhood of Ardagh, in the county of Longford; and thither Irish
legend represents him carrying away &Eacute;tain, queen of Eochaid
Airem, king of Ireland during a part of Conchobar MacNessa&rsquo;s
time. Now Eochaid was for a whole year unable to find where she was,
but his druid, Dal&aacute;n, wrote Ogams and at last found it out.
Eochaid then marched to Br&iacute; L&eacute;ith, and began to demolish
Mider&rsquo;s <i>s&iacute;d</i>, whereupon Mider was eventually so
frightened that he sent forth the queen to her husband, who then went
his way, leaving the mound folk to digest their wrath. For it is
characteristic of them that they did not fight, but chose to bide their
time for revenge. In this instance it did not arrive till long after
Eochaid&rsquo;s day<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11333src" href=
"#xd26e11333" name="xd26e11333src">32</a>. I may add that &Eacute;tain
was herself one of the <i>s&iacute;de</i> or fairies; and one of
Mider&rsquo;s reasons for taking her away was, that she had been his
wife in a previous stage of existence. Now it is true that the fairy
Mider is described as resembling the other heroes of Irish story, in
having golden yellow hair and bright <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb681" href="#pb681" name="pb681">681</a>]</span>blue eyes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e11341src" href="#xd26e11341" name=
"xd26e11341src">33</a>, but he differs completely from them in being no
warrior but a great wizard; and though he is not said to have been of
small stature, the dwarfs were not far off. For in describing the poet
Atherne, who was notorious for his stinginess (p. 635), the
story-teller emphasizes his words by representing him taking from Mider
three of his dwarfs and stationing them around his own house, in order
that their truculent looks and rude words might drive away anybody who
came to seek hospitality or to present an unwelcome request<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e11350src" href="#xd26e11350" name=
"xd26e11350src">34</a>, a r&ocirc;le which recalls that of Edern ab
Nu&#273;&rsquo;s dwarf already mentioned (p. 672). Here the Irish word
used is <i>corr</i>, which is probably to be identified with the
Brythonic <i>cor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo; though the better known
meaning of <i>corr</i> in Irish is &lsquo;crane or heron.&rsquo; From
the former also is hardly to be severed the Irish <i>corrguinigh</i>,
&lsquo;sorcerers,&rsquo; and <i>corrguinacht</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11374src" href="#xd26e11374" name="xd26e11374src">35</a>, or the
process of cursing to which the <i>corrguinigh</i> resorted, as, for
instance, when N&eacute;de called forth the fatal blisters on
Caier&rsquo;s face (p. 632). The r&ocirc;le would seem exactly to suit
the little people, who were consummate magicians.</p>
<p>Let me for a moment leave the little people, in order to call
attention to another side of this question of race. It has recently
been shown<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11406src" href="#xd26e11406"
name="xd26e11406src">36</a> by Professor J. Morris Jones, of the
University College of North Wales, that the non-Aryan traits of the
syntax of our insular Celtic point unmistakably to that of old Egyptian
and Berber, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb682" href="#pb682" name=
"pb682">682</a>]</span>together with kindred idioms belonging to the
southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. He has thereby reduced to
articulate speech, so to say, the physiognomical convictions of
Professor Sayce (p. 665), to which the reader&rsquo;s attention has
been called. To the linguistic argument he appends a statement cited
from a French authority and bearing on the question of descent by
birth, to the effect, that when among the Berbers the king dies or is
deposed, as happens often enough, it is not his son that is called to
succeed, but the son of his sister, as in the case of the historical
Picts of Scotland down to the twelfth century or thereabouts. Here I
would add, that my attention has been called by Professor Sayce to old
Egyptian monuments representing the Libyan chiefs with their bodies
tattooed, a habit which seems not to be yet extinct among the Touaregs
and Kabyles<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11414src" href="#xd26e11414"
name="xd26e11414src">37</a>. Lastly, Mr. Nicholson has recently
directed attention to the fact that some princes of ancient Gaul are
represented with their faces tattooed on certain coins found in the
west of France so far south as the region once occupied by the ancient
Pictones. We have a compendious commentary on this in the occurrence of
a word <i>Chortonicum</i> in a High German manuscript written before
the year 814: I allude to the Wessobrunn Codex at Munich, in which,
among a number of geographical names connected with Gaul and other
countries, that vocable is so placed as to allow of our referring it to
Poitou or to all Gaul as the country once of the ancient Pictones. The
great German philologist Pott, who called attention to it, brought it
at once into relation with <i>Cruithne</i>, plural <i>Cruithni</i>,
&lsquo;the Picts of Britain and Ireland,&rsquo; a word which has been
explained at p. 281 above<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11433src" href=
"#xd26e11433" name="xd26e11433src">38</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb683" href="#pb683" name="pb683">683</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now at last I come to the question, what pre-Celtic race or races
make themselves evident in the mass of things touched on in this and
the foregoing chapters? The answer must, I think, recognize at least
two. First comes the race of the mound folk, consisting of the short
swarthy people variously caricatured in our fairy tales. They formed
isolated fractions of a widely spread race possessed of no political
significance whatsoever; but, with the inconsistency ever clinging to
everything connected with the fairies, the weird and uncanny folk
emerging from its underground lairs seems to have exercised on other
races a sort of permanent spell of mysteriousness amounting to
adoration. In fact, Irish literature tells us that the
<i>s&iacute;de</i> were worshipped (p. 678). Owing to his faculty of
exaggeration, combined with his inability to comprehend the little
people, the Celt was enabled to bequeath to the great literatures of
Western Europe a motley train of dwarfs and brownies, a whole world of
wizardry and magic. The real race of the little people forms the lowest
stratum which we can reach, to wit, at a level no higher, seemingly,
than that of the present-day natives of Central Australia. Thus some of
the birth stories of C&uacute;chulainn and &Eacute;t&aacute;in seem to
have passed through their hands, and they bear a striking resemblance
to certain notions of the Lapps (pp. 657&ndash;8). In fact, the nature
of the habitations of our little people, together with other points
which might be mentioned, would seem at first sight to betoken affinity
with the Lapps; but I am warned by experts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11463src" href="#xd26e11463" name="xd26e11463src">39</a> that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb684" href="#pb684" name=
"pb684">684</a>]</span>there are serious craniological difficulties in
the way of any racial comparison with the Lapps, and that one must look
rather to the dwarf populations once widely spread over our hemisphere,
and still to be found here and there in Europe, as, for example, in
Sicily. To come nearer our British Isles, the presence of such dwarfs
has been established with regard to Switzerland in neolithic
times<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11473src" href="#xd26e11473" name=
"xd26e11473src">40</a>.</p>
<p>The other race may be called Picts, which is probably the earliest
of the names given it by the Celts; and their affinities appear to be
Libyan, possibly Iberian. It was a warlike stock, and stood higher
altogether than the mound inhabitants; for it had a notion of
paternity, though, on account of its promiscuity, it had to reckon
descent by birth (pp. 654&ndash;6). To it probably belonged all the
great family groups figuring in the <i>Mabinogion</i> and the
corresponding class of literature in Irish: this would include the
Danann-D&ocirc;n group and the Lir-&#7930;yr group, together with the
families represented by Pwy&#7931; and Rhiannon, who were inseparable
from the &#7930;yr group in Welsh, just as the Lir group was
inseparable from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb685" href="#pb685"
name="pb685">685</a>]</span>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann in Irish legend
(pp. 548&ndash;9). The Picts made slaves and drudges of the
mound-haunting race, but how far any amalgamation may have taken place
between them it is impossible to say. Even without any amalgamation,
however, the little people, if employed as nurses to their Pictish
lords&rsquo; children, could not help leaving their impress in time on
the language of the ruling nationality. But it may be that the
treatment of the Picts, by Scottish legend, as a kind of fairies really
points to amalgamation, though it is not impossible that
arch&aelig;ology may be able to classify the remains of the dwellings
ascribed to the Pechts, that is, to assign a certain class to the
warlike Picts of history and another to the dwarf race of the
<i>s&iacute;ds</i>. A certain measure of amalgamation may also be the
meaning of the Irish tradition, that when the Milesian Irish came and
conquered, the defeated Tuatha D&eacute; Danann gave up their life
above ground and retired inside the hills like the fairies. This
account of them may be as worthless as the story of the extermination
of the Picts of Scotland: both peoples doubtless lived on to amalgamate
in time with the conquering race; but it may mean that some of them
retreated before the Celts, and concealed themselves after the manner
of the little people&mdash;in underground dwellings in the less
accessible parts of the country. In any case, it may well be that they
got their magic and druidism from the dwellers of the
<i>s&iacute;ds</i>. In the next place, it has been pointed out (pp.
550&ndash;1) how the adjective <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old,
ancient,&rsquo; is applied in Welsh to several of the chief men of the
D&ocirc;n group, and by this one may probably understand that they were
old not merely to those who told the stories about them in Welsh, but
to those who put those stories together in Goidelic ages earlier. The
geography of the <i>Mabinogion</i> gives the prehistoric remains
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb686" href="#pb686" name=
"pb686">686</a>]</span>of Penmaen Mawr and Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri to the
D&ocirc;n group; but by its name, <i>Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> should be
the &lsquo;Town of the Keiri,&rsquo; a word probably referring to the
Picts (pp. 279&ndash;83): this, so far as it goes, makes the sons of
D&ocirc;n belong by race to the Picts. Lastly, it is the widely spread
race of the Picts, conquered by the Celts of the Celtican or Goidelic
branch and amalgamating with their conquerors in the course of time,
that has left its non-Aryan impress on the syntax of the Celtic
languages of the British Isles.</p>
<p>These, it is needless to say, are conjectures which I cannot
establish; but possibly somebody else may. For the present, however,
they cannot fail to suggest a moral, habitually ignored with a light
heart by most people&mdash;including the writer of these
words&mdash;that men in his plight, men engaged in studies which, owing
to a rapid accumulation of fresh facts or the blossoming of new
theories, are in a shifting condition, should abstain from producing
books or anything longer than a magazine article now and then. Even
such minor productions should be understood to be liable to be cast
into a great bonfire lit once a year, say on Halloween. This should
help to clear the air of mistaken hypotheses, whether of folklore and
myth or of history and language, and also serve to mark <i lang=
"cy">Nos <span class="corr" id="xd26e11508" title=
"Source: Galangaeaf">Calangaeaf</span></i> as the commencement of the
ancient Celtic year. The business of selecting the papers to be saved
from the burning might be delegated to an academy constituted, roughly
speaking, on the lines of Plato&rsquo;s aristocracy of intellect. Such
academy, once in the enjoyment of its existence, would also find plenty
of work in addition to the inquisitional business which I have
suggested: it should, for example, be invested with summary
jurisdiction over fond parents who venture to show any unreasonable
anxiety to save their mental progeny from the annual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb687" href="#pb687" name=
"pb687">687</a>]</span>bonfire. The best of that class of writers
should be ordered by the academy to sing songs or indite original
verse. As for the rest, some of them might be told off to gesticulate
to the gallery, and some to administer the consolations of platitude to
stragglers tired of the march of science. There is a mass of other
useful work which would naturally devolve on an academy of the kind
here suggested. I should be happy, if space permitted, to go through
the particulars one by one, but let a single instance suffice: the
academy might relieve us of the painful necessity of having seriously
to consider any further the proposal that professors found professing
after sixty should be shot. This will serve to indicate the kind of
work which might advantageously be entrusted to the august body which
is here but roughly projected.</p>
<p>There are some branches of learning in the happy position of having
no occasion for such a body academical. Thus, if a man will have it
that the earth is flat, as flat in fact as some people do their utmost
to make it, &lsquo;he will most likely,&rsquo; as the late Mr. Freeman
in the <i>Saturday Review</i> once put it, &lsquo;make few converts,
and will be forgotten after at most a passing laugh from scientific
men.&rsquo; If a man insists that the sum of two and two is five, he
will probably find his way to a lunatic asylum, as the economy of
society is, in a manner, self-acting. So with regard to him who carries
his craze into the more material departments of such a science as
chemistry: he may be expected to blow out his own eyes, for the
almighty molecule executes its own vengeance. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; to
quote again from Mr. Freeman, if that man&rsquo;s &lsquo;craze had been
historical or philological&rsquo;&mdash;and above all if it had to do
with the science of man or of myth&mdash;&lsquo;he might have put forth
notions quite as absurd as the notion that the earth is flat, and many
people would not have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb688" href=
"#pb688" name="pb688">688</a>]</span>in the least able to see that they
were absurd. If any scholar had tried to confute him we should have
heard of &ldquo;controversies&rdquo; and &ldquo;differences of
opinion.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; In fact, the worst that happens to the
false prophet who shines in any such a science is, that he has usually
only too many enthusiastic followers. The machinery is, so to say, not
automatic, and hence it is that we want the help of an academy. But
even supposing such an academy established, no one need feel alarmed
lest opportunities enough could no longer be found for cultivating the
example of those of the early Christians who had the rare grace to
suffer fools gladly.</p>
<p>Personally, however, I should be against doing anything in a hurry;
and, considering how little his fellows dare expect from the man who is
just waiting to be final and perfect before he commit himself to type,
the establishment of an academy invested with the summary powers which
have been briefly sketched might, perhaps, after all, conveniently wait
a while: my own feeling is that almost any time, say in the latter half
of the twentieth century, would do better than this year or the next.
In the meantime one must be content to entrust the fortunes of our
studies to the combined forces of science and common sense. Judging by
what they have achieved in recent years, there is no reason to be
uneasy with regard to the time to come, for it is as true to-day as
when it was first written, that the best of the prophets of the Future
is the Past. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb689" href="#pb689" name=

has, however, to admit that the same agency may also mar the picture.
Since the above was written I have read in Stokes&rsquo; <i lang=
"de">Festschrift</i>, pp. 7&ndash;19, a very interesting article by L.
Chr. Stern, in which he discusses some of the difficulties attaching to
the term <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i>. Among other things he suggests
that there was a certain amount of confusion between <i>Danann</i> and
<i>d&aacute;na</i>, genitive of <i>d&aacute;n</i>, &lsquo;art or
profession&rsquo;&mdash;the word <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb646n"
href="#pb646n" name="pb646n">646</a>]</span>meant also &lsquo;lot or
destiny,&rsquo; being probably of the same origin as the Latin <i lang=
"la">donum</i>, in Welsh <i lang="cy">dawn</i>, which means a gift, and
especially &lsquo;the gift of the gab.&rsquo; But it would invert the
natural sequence to suppose any such a formula as <i>Tuatha D&eacute;
D&aacute;na</i> to have preceded <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i>; for
why should anybody substitute an obscure vocable <i>Danann</i> for
<i>d&aacute;na</i> of well-known meaning? Dr. Stern has some doubts as
to the Welsh D&ocirc;n being a female; but it would have been more
satisfactory if he had proved his surmise, or at any rate shown that
<i>D&ocirc;n</i> has nothing to do with <i>Danann</i> or <i>Donann</i>.
I am satisfied with such a passage in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math as
that where Gwydion, addressing Math, describes Arianrhod, daughter of
D&ocirc;n, in the words, <i>dy nith uerch dy ch&#7933;aer</i>,
&lsquo;thy niece daughter of thy sister&rsquo;: see the
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 68, and, for similar references to other children
of D&ocirc;n, consult pp. 59 and 65. Arianrhod is in the older Triads,
i. 40, ii. 15, called daughter of Beli, whom one can only have regarded
as her father. So for the present I continue to accept Stokes&rsquo;
rendering of <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i> as &lsquo;the Folks of the
Goddess Danu.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

versions of a story to account for the Ultonian couvade have been
published with a translation into German, by Prof. Windisch, in the
<i lang="de">Berichte der k. s&auml;chs. Gesellschaft der
Wissenschaften</i> (<i lang="de">phil.-hist. Classe</i>) for 1884, pp.
338 et seq. Sundry references to the couvade will also be found in my
<i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, where certain mythological suggestions made
with reference to it require to be reconsidered. But when touching on
this point it occurred to me that the wholesale couvade of the Ultonian
braves, at one and the same time of the year, implied that the birth of
Ultonian children, or at any rate those of them that were to be reared,
took place (in some period or other of the history of their race) at a
particular season of the year, namely, about the beginning of the
winter, that is when food would be most abundant. I have since been
confirmed in this view by perusing Westermarck&rsquo;s work on the
<i>History of Human Marriage</i>, and by reading especially his second
chapter entitled &lsquo;A Human Pairing Season in Primitive
Times.&rsquo; For there I find a considerable body of instances in
point, together with a summary treatment of the whole question. But in
the case of promiscuity, such as originally prevailed doubtless at the
Ultonian Court, the question what men were to go into couvade could
only be settled by the confinement of them all, wherein we have an
alternative if not an additional reason for a simultaneous
couvade.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e10451src">&uarr;</a></p>

where one reads as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Added to this we have amongst
the Arunta, Luritcha, and Ilpirra tribes, and probably also amongst
others such as the Warramunga, the idea firmly held that the child is
not the direct result of intercourse, that it may come without this,
which merely, as it were, prepares the mother for the reception and
birth also of an already-formed spirit child who inhabits one of the
local totem centres. Time after time we have questioned them on this
point, and always received the reply that the child was not the direct
result of intercourse.&rsquo; It is curious to note how readily the
Australian notion here presented would develop into that of the Lapps,

difference between Mod. Welsh <i>cor</i> and Breton <i>korr</i> is one
of spelling, for the reformed orthography of Welsh words only doubles
the <i>r</i> where it is dwelt on in the accented syllable of a longer
word: in other terms, when that syllable closes with the consonant and
the next syllable begins with it. Thus <i>cor</i> has, as its
derivatives, <i>c&oacute;r-rach</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo; plural
<i>co-r&aacute;chod</i>, <i>c&oacute;r-ryn</i>, &lsquo;a male
dwarf,&rsquo; plural <i>co-r&yacute;nnod</i>. Some of these enter into
place-names, such as <i>Cwm Corryn</i> near &#7930;anaelhaearn (p.
217<span class="corr" id="xd26e10880" title="Not in source">)</span>
and <i>Cwm Corryn</i> draining into the Vale of Neath; so possibly with
<i>Corwen</i> for <i>Cor-waen</i>, in the sense of &lsquo;the
Fairies&rsquo; Meadow.&rsquo; <i>Cor</i> and <i>corryn</i> are also
used for the spider, as in <i>gwe&rsquo;r cor</i> or <i>gwe&rsquo;r
corryn</i>, &lsquo;a spider&rsquo;s web,&rsquo; the spider being so
called on account of its spinning, an occupation in which the fairies
are represented likewise frequently engaged; not to mention that
gossamer (<i>gwawn</i>) is also sometimes regarded as a product of the
fairy loom (p. 103). The derivation of <i>cor</i> is not satisfactorily
cleared up: it has been conjectured to be related to a Med. Irish word
<i>cert</i>, &lsquo;small, little,&rsquo; and Latin <i>curtus</i>,
&lsquo;shortened or mutilated.&rsquo; To me this means that the origin
of the word still remains to be discovered.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

chiefly indebted to my friend Professor A. C. Haddon for references to
information as to the dwarf races of prehistoric times. I find also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb684n" href="#pb684n" name=
"pb684n">684</a>]</span>that he, among others, has anticipated me in my
theory as to the origins of the fairies: witness the following extract
from the syllabus of a lecture delivered by him at Cardiff in 1894 on
<i>Fairy Tales</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;What are the fairies?&mdash;Legendary
origin of the fairies. It is evident from fairy literature that there
is a mixture of the possible and the impossible, of fact and fancy.
Part of fairydom refers to (1) spirits that never were embodied: other
fairies are (2) spirits of environment, nature or local spirits, and
household or domestic spirits; (3) spirits of the organic world,
spirits of plants, and spirits of animals; (4) spirits of men or
ghosts; and (5) witches and wizards, or men possessed with other
spirits. All these and possibly other elements enter into the fanciful
aspect of fairyland, but there is a large residuum of real occurrences;
these point to a clash of races, and we may regard many of these fairy
sagas as stories told by men of the Iron Age of events which happened
to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of the Neolithic
Age, and possibly these, too, handed on traditions of the
Pal&aelig;olithic Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">P. 81. I learn that the plural of <i>bodach glas</i>
was in Welsh <i>bodachod gleision</i>, a term which Elis o&rsquo;r Nant
remembers his mother applying to a kind of fairies dressed in blue and
fond of leading people astray. She used to relate how a haymaking party
once passed a summer&rsquo;s night at the cowhouse (<i>beudy</i>) of
Bryn Bygely&#273; (also <i>Bryn Mygely&#273;</i>), and how they saw in
the dead of night a host of these dwarfs (<i>corynnod</i>) in blue
dancing and capering about the place. The <i>beudy</i> in question is
not very far from Dolwy&#273;elan, on the way to Capel Curig. A
different picture of the <i>bodach</i> is given in Jenkins&rsquo;
<i>Be&#273; Gelert</i>, p. 82; and lastly one may contrast the Highland
<i>Bodach Glas</i> mentioned at p. 520 above, not to mention still
another kind, namely the one in Scott&rsquo;s <i>Waverley</i>.</p>
<p>P. 130. To <i>Sarn yr Afanc</i> add <i>&#7930;yn yr Afanc</i>, near
&#7930;an&#273;inam (<i>Beauties of Wales</i>, N. Wales, p. 841), and
<i>Be&#273; yr Afanc</i>, &lsquo;the Afanc&rsquo;s Grave,&rsquo; the
name of some sort of a tumulus, I am told, on a knoll near the
Pembrokeshire stream of the Nevern. Mr. J. Thomas, of Bancau Bryn
Berian close by, has communicated to me certain echoes of a story how
an afanc was caught in a pool near the bridge of Bryn Berian, and how
it was taken up to be interred in what is now regarded as its grave. A
complete list of the afanc place-names in the Principality might
possibly prove instructive. As to the word <i>afanc</i>, what seems to
have happened is this: (1) from meaning simply a dwarf it came to be
associated with such water dwarfs as those mentioned at p. 432; (2) the
meaning being forgotten, the word was applied to any water monster; and
(3) where <i>afanc</i> occurs in place-names the Hu story has been
introduced to explain it, whether it fitted or not. This I should fancy
to be the case with the Bryn Berian barrow, and it would be
satisfactory to know whether it contains the remains of an ordinary
dwarf. Peredur&rsquo;s lake afanc may have been a dwarf; but whether
that was so or not, it is remarkable that the weapon which the afanc
handled was a <i>&#7931;echwaew</i> or flake-spear, that is, a missile
tipped with stone.</p>
<p>P. 131. With the r&ocirc;le of the girl in the afanc story compare
that of Tegau, wife of Caradog Freichfras, on whom a serpent fastens
and can only be allured away to seize on one of Tegau&rsquo;s breasts,
of which she loses the nipple when the beast is cut off. The defect
being replaced with gold, she is ever after known as <i>Tegau
Eur-fron</i>, or &lsquo;Tegau of the golden Breast.&rsquo; That is a
version inferred of a story which is discussed by M. Gaston Paris in an
article, on <i>Caradoc et le Serpent</i>, elicited by a paper published
(in the November number of <i>Modern Language Notes</i> for 1898) by
Miss C. A. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb690" href="#pb690" name=
"pb690">690</a>]</span>Harper, of Bryn Mawr College, U.S.: see the
<i>Romania</i>, xxviii. 214&ndash;31. One of Miss Harper&rsquo;s
parallels, mentioned by M. Paris at p. 220, comes from Campbell: it is
concerning a prince who receives from his stepmother a magic shirt
which converts itself into a serpent coiled round his neck, and of
which he is rid by the help of a woman acting in much the same way as
Tegau. We have an echo of this in the pedigrees in the Jesus College
MS. 20: see the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, viii. 88, where one reads of <i lang=
"cy">G&#7933;ga&#7933;n keneu menrud a vu neidyr vl&#7933;ydyn am y
von&#7933;gyl</i>, &lsquo;Gwgon the whelp of <i>Menrud</i> (?) who was
a year with a snake round his neck&rsquo;&mdash;his pedigree is also
given. In M. Paris&rsquo; suggested reconstruction of the story (p.
228) from the different versions, he represents the maiden who is to
induce the serpent to leave the man on whom it has fastened, as
standing in a vessel filled with milk, while the man stands in a vessel
filled with vinegar. The heroine exposes herself to the reptile, which
relinquishes his present victim to seize on one of the woman&rsquo;s
breasts. Now the appropriateness of the milk is explained by the belief
that snakes are inordinately fond of milk, and that belief has, I
presume, a foundation in fact: at any rate I am reminded of its
introduction into the plot of more than one English story, such as
Stanley Weyman&rsquo;s book <i>From the Memoirs of a Minister of
France</i> (London, 1895), p. 445, and A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s
<i>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> (London, 1893), pp. 199&ndash;209.
In Wales, however, it is to a woman&rsquo;s milk that one&rsquo;s
interest attaches: I submit two references which will explain what I
mean. The first of them is to Owen&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Folk-Lore</i>, p.
349, where he says that &lsquo;traditions of flying snakes were once
common in all parts of Wales,&rsquo; and adds as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The traditional origin of these imaginary
creatures was that they were snakes, which by having drunk the milk of
a woman, and by having eaten of bread consecrated for the Holy
Communion, became transformed into winged serpents or dragons.&rsquo;
The other is to the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 190, where one reads in
Welsh to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;If a snake chances to have
an opportunity to drink of a woman&rsquo;s milk it is certain to become
a <i>gwiber</i>. When a woman happens to be far from her child, and her
breasts are full and beginning to give her pain, she sometimes milks
them on the ground in order to ease them. To this the peasantry in
parts of Cardiganshire have a strong objection, lest a snake should
come there and drink the milk, and so become a <i>gwiber</i>.&rsquo;
The word <i>gwiber</i> is used in the Welsh Bible for a viper, but the
editor of the <i>Brython</i> explains, that in our folklore it means a
huge kind of snake or dragon that has grown wings and has its body
cased in hard scales: for a noted instance in point he refers the
reader to the first number of the <i>Brython</i>, p. 3. It is believed
still all over Wales that snakes may, under favourable circumstances,
develop wings: in fact, an Anglesey man strongly wished, to my
knowledge, to offer to the recent Welsh Land Commission, as evidence of
the wild and neglected state of a certain farm, that the gorse had
grown so high and the snakes so thriven in it that he had actually seen
one of the latter flying right across a wide road which separated two
such gorse forests as he described: surprised and hurt to find that
this was not accepted, he inferred that the Commissioners knew next to
nothing about their business.</p>
<p>Pp. 148, 170. With &lsquo;the spell of security&rsquo; by catching
hold of grass may perhaps be compared a habit which boys in
Cardiganshire have of suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb691"
href="#pb691" name="pb691">691</a>]</span>picking up a blade of grass
when they want a truce or stoppage in a sort of game of tig or
touchwood. The grass gives the one who avails himself of it immunity
for a time from attack or pursuit, so as to allow him to begin the game
again just where it was left off.</p>
<p>P. 228. <i>Bodermud</i> would probably be more correctly written
<i>Bodermyd</i>, and analysed possibly into <i>Bod-&#272;ermyd</i>,
involving the name which appears in Irish as <i>Diarmait</i> and
<i>Dermot</i>.</p>
<p>P. 230. Since this was printed I have been assured by Mr. Thomas
Prichard of &#7930;wydiarth Esgob, in Anglesey, that the <i>dolur
byr</i> is more commonly called <i>clwy&rsquo; byr</i>, and that it is
the disease known in English as &lsquo;black quarter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pp. 259, 268. I am assured on the part of several literary natives
of Glamorgan that they do not know <i>d&acirc;r</i> for <i>daear</i>,
&lsquo;ground, earth.&rsquo; Such negative evidence, though proving the
literary form <i>daear</i> to prevail now, is not to be opposed to the
positive statement, sent by Mr. Hughes (p. 173) to me, as to the
persistence in his neighbourhood of <i>d&acirc;r</i> and
<i>cl&acirc;r</i> (for <i>claear</i>, &lsquo;lukewarm&rsquo;), to which
one may add, as unlikely to be challenged by anybody, the case of
<i>h&#259;rn</i> for <i>haearn</i>, &lsquo;iron.&rsquo; The
intermediate forms have to be represented as <i>daer</i>, <i>claer</i>,
and <i>haern</i>, which explain exactly the <i>gaem</i> of the <i>Book
of St. Chad</i>, for which modern literary Welsh has <i>gaeaf</i>,
&lsquo;winter&rsquo;: see the preface to the <i>Book of &#7930;an
D&acirc;v</i>, p. xlv.</p>
<p>P. 290. It ought to have been pointed out that the fairies, whose
food and drink it is death to share, represent the dead.</p>
<p>P. 291. For <i>Conla</i> read <i>Connla</i> or <i>Condla</i>: the
later form is <i>Colla</i>. The Condla in question is called <i>Condla
R&uacute;ad</i> in the story, but the heading to it has <i>Ectra Condla
Chaim</i>, &lsquo;the Adventure of C. the Dear One.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 294. I am now inclined to think that <i>butch</i> was produced
out of the northern pronunciation of <i>witch</i> by regarding its
<i>w</i> as a mutation consonant and replacing it, as in some other
instances, by <i>b</i> as the radical.</p>
<p>P. 308. With the Manx use of rowan on May-day compare a passage to
the following effect concerning Wales&mdash;I translate it from the
faulty Welsh in which it is quoted by one of the competitors for the
folklore prize at the Liverpool Eiste&#273;fod, 1900: he gave no
indication of its provenance:&mdash;Another bad papistic habit which
prevails among some Welsh people is that of placing some of the wood of
the rowan tree (<i>coed cer&#273;in</i> or <i>criafol</i>) in their
corn lands (<i>&#7931;afyrieu</i>) and their fields on May-eve (<i>Nos
Glamau</i>) with the idea that such a custom brings a blessing on their
fields, a proceeding which would better become atheists and pagans than
Christians.</p>
<p>P. 325. In the comparison with the brownie the fairy nurse in the
Pennant Valley has been overlooked: see p. 109.</p>
<p>P. 331, line 1. For I. 42&ndash;3 read ii. 42&ndash;3.</p>
<p>Pp. 377, 395. With the story of Ffynnon Gywer and the other fairy
wells, also with the wells which have been more especially called
sacred in this volume, compare the following paragraph from
Martin&rsquo;s <i>Description of the Western Islands of Scotland</i>
(London, 1703), pp. 229&ndash;30: it is concerning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb692" href="#pb692" name=
"pb692">692</a>]</span>Gigay, now more commonly written <i>Gigha</i>,
the name of an island near the west coast of
Kintyre:&mdash;&lsquo;There is a well in the north end of this isle
called Toubir-more, i. e. a great well, because of its effects, for
which it is famous among the islanders; who together with the
inhabitants use it as a <i>Catholicon</i> for diseases. It&rsquo;s
covered with stone and clay, because the natives fancy that the stream
that flows from it might overflow the isle; and it is always opened by
a <i>Diroch</i>, i. e. an inmate, else they think it would not exert
its vertues. They ascribe one very extraordinary effect to it, and
&rsquo;tis this; that when any foreign boats are wind-bound here (which
often happens) the master of the boat ordinarily gives the native that
lets the water run a piece of money, and they say that immediately
afterwards the wind changes in favour of those that are thus
detain&rsquo;d by contrary winds. Every stranger that goes to drink of
the water of this well, is accustomed to leave on its stone cover a
piece of money, a needle, pin, or one of the prettiest <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e11843" title="Source: varieated">variegated</span>
stones they can find.&rsquo; Last September I visited Gigha and saw a
well there which is supposed to be the one to which Martin refers. It
is very insignificant and known now by a name pronounced <i lang=
"ga">Tobar a ve&#775;ac</i>, possibly for an older <i>Mo-Bheac</i>: in
Scotch Gaelic <i>B&euml;ac</i>, written <i>Beathag</i>, is equated with
the name Sophia. The only tradition now current about the well is that
emptying it used to prove the means of raising a wind or even of
producing great storms, and this appears to have been told Pennant: see
his <i>Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides, MDCCLXXII</i>
(Chester, 1774), p. 226:&mdash;&lsquo;Visit the few wonders of the
isle: the first is a little well of a most miraculous quality, for in
old times, if ever the chieftain lay here wind-bound, he had nothing
more to do than cause the well to be cleared, and instantly a favorable
gale arose. But miracles are now ceased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. 378. A similar rhyme is current in the neighbourhood of
Dolge&#7931;ey, as Miss Lucy Griffith informs me, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Dolge&#7931;e dol a go&#7931;ir,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Daear a&rsquo;i &#7931;wnc, dw&rsquo;r &rsquo;n
&rsquo;i &#7931;e</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Dolge&#7931;ey, a dale to be lost;</p>
<p class="line">Earth will swallow it, and water take its place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">P. 394. With regard to wells killing women visiting
them, I may mention a story, told me the other day by Professor Mahaffy
after a friend whose name he gave, concerning the inhabitants of one of
the small islands on the coast of Mayo&mdash;I understood him to say
off the Mullet. It was this: all the men and boys, having gone fishing,
were prevented by rough weather from returning as soon as they
intended, and the women left alone suffered greatly from want of water,
as not one of them would venture to go to the well. By-and-by, however,
one of them gave birth to a boy, whereupon another of them carried the
baby to the well, and ventured to draw water.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb418" class="pageref">418</a>. As to <i>Clychau
Aberdyfi</i> I am now convinced that the <i>chwech</i> and <i>saith</i>
are entirely due to the published versions, the editors of which seem
to have agreed that they will have as much as possible for their money,
so to say. I find that Mrs. Rhys learnt in her childhood to end the
words with <i>pump</i>, and that she cannot now be brought to sing the
melody in any other way: I have similar testimony from a musical lady
from the neighbourhood of Wrexham; and, doubtless, more evidence of the
same sort could be got.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb443" class="pageref">443</a>. For &#7930;ywelyn ab
Gruffy&#273; read &#7930;ywelyn ab Iorwerth. <span class=

<p>Pp. <a href="#pb450" class="pageref">450</a>&ndash;1. Some
additional light on the doggerel dialogue will be found thrown by the
following story, which I find cited in Welsh by one of the Liverpool
Eiste&#273;fod competitors:&mdash;There is in the parish of Yspytty
Ifan, in Carnarvonshire, a farm called Trwyn Swch, where eighty years
ago lived a man and his wife, who were both young, and had twins born
to them. Now the mother went one day to milk, leaving the twins alone
in the cradle&mdash;the husband was not at home&mdash;and who should
enter the house but one of the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i>! He took the twins
away and left two of his own breed in the cradle in their stead.
Thereupon the mother returned home and saw what had come to pass; she
then in her excitement snatched the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i> twins and took
them to the bridge that crosses the huge gorge of the river Conwy not
very far from the house, and she cast them into the whirlpool below. By
this time the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i> had come on the spot, some trying to
save the children, and some making for the woman. &lsquo;Seize the old
hag!&rsquo; (<i>Crap ar yr hen wrach!</i>) said one of the chiefs of
the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i>. &lsquo;Too late!&rsquo; cried the woman on the
edge of the bank; and many of them ran after her to the house. As they
ran three or four of them lost their pipes in the field. They are pipes
ingeniously made of the blue stone (<i>carreg las</i>) of the gully.
They measure three or four inches long, and from time to time several
of them have been found near the cave of Trwyn Swch.&mdash;This is the
first indication which I have discovered, that the fairies are addicted
to smoking.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb506" class="pageref">506</a>. A <i>Rhiw
Gyferthwch</i> (printed <i>Rywgyverthwch</i>) occurs in the <i>Record
of Carnarvon</i>, p. 200; but it seems to have been in Merionethshire,
and far enough from Arfon.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb521" class="pageref">521</a>. In the article already
cited from the <i>Romania</i>, M. Paris finds Twrch Trwyth in the boar
<i>Tortain</i> of a French romance: see xxviii. 217, where he mentions
a legend concerning the strange pedigree of that beast. The subject
requires to be further studied.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb535" class="pageref">535</a>. A less probable
explanation of <i>Latio</i> would be to suppose <i>orti</i> understood.
This has been suggested to me by Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s treatment of the
&#7930;anaelhaiarn inscription as <i>Ali ortus Elmetiaco hic iacet</i>,
where I should regard <i>Ali</i> as standing for an earlier nominative
<i>Alec-s</i>, and intended as the Celtic equivalent for <i>Cephas</i>
or <i>Peter</i>: <i>Ali</i> would be the word which is in Med. Irish
<i>ail</i>, genitive <i>ailech</i>, &lsquo;a rock or stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb545" class="pageref">545</a>. We have the
<i>Maethwy</i> of Gilvaethwy possibly still further reduced to
<i>Aethwy</i> in <i>Porth Aethwy</i>, &lsquo;the Village of Menai
Bridge,&rsquo; in spite of its occurring in the <i>Record of
Carnarvon</i>, p. 77, as <i>Porthaytho</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb548" class="pageref">548</a>. To the reference to the
<i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 170, as to Beli being called son of Anna, add the
Welsh <i>Elucidarium</i>, p. 127, with its <i>belim vab anna</i>, and
<i>The Cambro-British Saints</i>, p. 82, where we have <i>Anna &hellip;
genuit Beli</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb560" class="pageref">560</a>. Two answers to the
query as to the <i>&#7930;ech Las</i> are now to be found in the
<i>Scottish Antiquary</i>, xv. 41&ndash;3.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb566" class="pageref">566</a>. Caer Gai is called also
<i>Caer Gynyr</i>, after Cai&rsquo;s father Cynyr, to wit in a poem by
William &#7930;eyn, who died in 1587. This I owe to Professor J. Morris
Jones, who has copied it from a collection of that poet&rsquo;s works
in the possession of Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, fo. 119. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb694" href="#pb694" name="pb694">694</a>]</span></p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb569" class="pageref">569</a>. Here it would, perhaps,
not be irrelevant to mention <i>Caer &#272;wrgynt</i>, given s. v.
<i>Dwr</i> in Morris&rsquo; <i>Celtic Remains</i>, as a name of
<i>Caergybi</i>, or Holyhead. His authority is given in parenthesis
thus: (Th. Williams, <i>Catal</i>.). I should be disposed to think the
name based on some such an earlier form as <i>Kair D&#7933;bgint</i>,
&lsquo;the Fortress of the Danes,&rsquo; who were called in old Welsh
<i>Dub-gint</i> (<i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i>, <span class="sc">A.
D.</span> 866, in the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 165), that is to say
&lsquo;<i>Gentes Nigr&aelig;</i> or Black Pagans,&rsquo; and more
simply <i>Gint</i> or <i>Gynt</i>, &lsquo;<i>Gentes</i> or
Heathens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pp. <a href="#pb579" class="pageref">579</a>&ndash;80. The word
<i>banna&#7933;c</i>, whence the later <i>bannog</i>, seems to be the
origin of the name <i>bonoec</i> given to the famous horn in the <i>Lai
du Corn</i>, from which M. Paris in his <i>Romania</i> article, xxviii.
229, cites <i>Cest cor qui bonoec a non</i>, &lsquo;this horn which is
called <i>bonoec</i>.&rsquo; The Welsh name would have to be <i>Corn
(yr) ych banna&#7933;c</i>, &lsquo;the horn of (the) <i>bannog</i>
ox,&rsquo; with or without the article.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb580" class="pageref">580</a>, note 1. One of the
Liverpool Eiste&#273;fod competitors cites W. O. Pughe to the following
effect in Welsh:&mdash;<i>&#7930;yn dau Ychain</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of
Two Oxen,&rsquo; is on Hiraethog Mountain; and near it is the footmark
of one of them in a stone or rock (<i>carreg</i>), where he rested when
seeking his partner, as the local legend has it. Another cites a still
wilder story, to the effect that there was once a wonderful cow called
<i>Y Fuwch Fraith</i>, &lsquo;the Parti-coloured Cow.&rsquo; &lsquo;To
that cow there came a witch to get milk, just after the cow had
supplied the whole neighbourhood. So the witch could not get any milk,
and to avenge her disappointment she made the cow mad. The result was
that the cow ran wild over the mountains, inflicting immense harm on
the country; but at last she was killed by Hu near Hiraethog, in the
county of Denbigh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb592" class="pageref">592</a>. With <i>trwtan</i>,
<i>Trwtyn-Tratyn</i>, and <i>Trit-a-trot</i> should doubtless be
compared the English use of <i>trot</i> as applied contemptuously to a
woman, as when Grumio, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>, Act i, sc. 2, speaks of &lsquo;an old <i>trot</i> with
ne&rsquo;er a tooth in her head&rsquo;: the word was similarly used by
Thomas Heywood and others.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb649" class="pageref">649</a>. With regard to note 1,
I find that Professor Zimmer is of opinion&mdash;in fact he is quite
positive&mdash;that <i>tyngu</i> and <i>tynghed</i> are in no way
related: see the <i lang="de">G&ouml;ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen</i>
for 1900 (No. 5), pp. 371&ndash;2.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#pb673" class="pageref">673</a>. I am tempted to rank
with the man-eating fairies the Atecotti, who are known to have been
cannibals, and whose name seems to mean the <i>ancient</i> race. Should
this prove tenable, one would have to admit that the little people, or
at any rate peoples with an admixture of the blood of that race, could
be trained to fight. Further, one would probably have to class with
them also such non-cannibal tribes as those of the Fir Bolg and the
Gali&uacute;in of Irish story. Information about both will be found in
my <i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, in reading which, however, the mythological
speculations should be brushed aside. Lastly, I anticipate that most of
the peoples figuring in the oldest class of Irish story will prove to
have belonged either (1) to the dwarf race, or (2) to the Picts; and
that careful reading will multiply the means of distinguishing between
them. Looking comprehensively at the question of the early races of the
British Isles, the reader should weigh again the concluding words of
Professor Haddon&rsquo;s theory, quoted on p. 684 above. <span class=

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Celtic Folklore: Welsh and Manx
(Volume 2 of 2), by John Rhys

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CELTIC FOLKLORE: WELSH, MANX, VOL 2 ***

***** This file should be named 55989-h.htm or 55989-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/5/9/8/55989/

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg. (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
